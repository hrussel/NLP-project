Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 30 minutes.
Drain and allow cool, then peel and dice.
Place the diced potatoes into a large mixing bowl and refrigerate until cold.
Once cold, fold in the mayonnaise, celery, eggs, chicken, mustard, olives, salt, and pickles.
Refrigerate 2 hours before serving.
