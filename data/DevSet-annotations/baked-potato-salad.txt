Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water.
Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes.
Drain the potatoes, and allow to cool to room temperature.
Dice once cooled.
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
Allow to cool, and crumble the bacon into a large bowl.
Place the cooled potatoes into the bowl with the bacon, and mix in the sour cream, mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, chives, salt, and pepper.
Refrigerate overnight before serving.
