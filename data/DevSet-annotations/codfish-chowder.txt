Cook bacon in a soup pot over medium heat until crisp and brown, about 10 minutes.
Remove bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in the pot.
Cook and stir onion and red bell pepper until softened, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
Stir in garlic and seafood seasoning and cook and stir 2 more minutes.
Pour in chicken broth and stir in potatoes and corn; add water if needed to cover vegetables.
Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low; simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
Stir in milk and butter until butter has melted; mix in reserved bacon.
Bring the soup just to the boiling point and stir in cod and parsley; cook, stirring occasionally, until fish flakes easily, 5 to 8 minutes.
