Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together ground beef, crushed crackers, onion, eggs, 3/4 cup ketchup, and 1/4 cup brown sugar until well blended.
Press into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Lay the two slices of bacon over the top.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until cooked through.
While the loaf bakes, mix together the remaining 1 cup ketchup, vinegar, salt, mustard and 1/2 cup brown sugar.
Spread over the top of the meat loaf for the last 15 minutes of baking.
