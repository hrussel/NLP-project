Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix bananas, salad dressing, and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Stir flour, baking soda, and salt into banana mixture until batter is just moistened. Divide batter evenly into 24 muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes.
