Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
One at a time, slip a tortilla into the hot oil.
If the tortilla starts to puff up, press it down with a fork.
When crisp and brown, remove to paper towels.
Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Place the chicken in a bowl, and separate with a fork.
Stir in the mayonnaise.
Dice the jalapenos (reserving the liquid), and stir them into chicken salad.
Pour in 1 tablespoon jalapeno juice, season with salt and pepper, and stir well.
To serve, spread the chicken salad on the tostadas.
