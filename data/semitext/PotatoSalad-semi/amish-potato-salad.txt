Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until easily pierced with afork.
Drain, and set aside to cool.
While the potatoes are cooking, whisk together 2 eggs, sugar, cornstarch, andsalt in a saucepan.
Stir in the vinegar, milk, and mustard.
Cook over mediumheat, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 10 minutes.
Remove fromheat, and stir in the butter.
Refrigerate until cool, then stir in themayonnaise.
Peel the potatoes if desired, and cut into medium dice.
Place in a large bowl,and toss with the onion, celery, carrots, celery seed and hard-cooked eggs.
Gently fold in the dressing.
Refrigerate until serving.
I personally like thisto sit for at least a day before serving to let the flavors blend, but you mayserve it as soon as it is chilled.
