In a non-reactive saucepan, combine the cider vinegar, salt, brown sugar,black pepper, cayenne pepper, and butter.
Bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat.
Mix in the water, and return to boil.
Sauce the pork beforesmoking, and then every hour or so while it cooks.
Start the pork butt on a slow smoker using hardwood coals or charcoalbriquettes and mesquite or apple wood chips.
Smoke the pork for at least 6hours and up to 10.
The longer the smoke time, the deeper the 'smoke ring', ared ring of flavor, will penetrate.
After the meat has smoked for 6 to 10 hours, use aluminum foil to wrap themeat.
Fold the edges of two sheets together to form a watertight seal.
Placethe meat in the center and bring the edges up to the top, cupping the meat.
Pour 1 cup of the sauce over the meat and then seal the foil tightly aroundthe roast.
Place the meat package back on the smoker, or in a 350 degree oven (175degrees C).
If it is on the smoker, increase the heat.
Cook the package untilthe meat pulls easily from the bone.
This can be checked easily by pushing onthe top of the foil package with an oven-mitted hand to test for softness.
Itwill take up to 2 hours.
Once the meat is done, remove it from the smoker or oven and let it cool.
Pullthe pork from the bone and discard the fat and gristle.
Pull the meat apart inlarge chunks about 1 inch wide by 4 inches long.
Place the meat chunks in a pan and pour about one cup of sauce for every 4pounds of meat, or to taste.
Heat until simmering.
Serve immediately or letmarinate for several days.
The meat can also be pulled into smaller piecesusing 2 forks, this is locally known as 'shredded pork'.
