To make the mayonnaise, beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl with an electricmixer or hand blender.
Slowly blend in the oil, one tablespoon at a time whilemixing constantly.
Continue to add oil until the consistency is a littlethicker than regular mayonnaise.
Pierce the garlic clove, and stir it aroundin the mixture until it releases its juice.
Remove the garlic and season withsalt and pepper.
Mix in the red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon at a time.
Go slow,this will thin the mayonnaise a bit.
Place the eggs in a large pot with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil,then simmer for 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat, drain and cool.
Peel off theshells, and cut eggs in half lengthwise.
Remove the yolks, and place them intoa medium bowl.
Place the egg whites on a serving plate.
To the yolks, add shallot, salmon, 1/2 cup of the mayonnaise, salt and pepper.
Mix until well blended.
If the mixture seems dry, stir in more mayonnaise.
Spoon into the egg white halves and chill or serve.
