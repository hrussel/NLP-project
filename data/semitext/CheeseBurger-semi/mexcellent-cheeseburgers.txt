Divide the ground beef into three even portions.
Season each one with some hotpepper sauce.
I ball up the meat, and poke my finger into it, then fill thehole with hot sauce.
Flatten into patties just a little larger than theEnglish muffins.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.
Cover, and cook the beef patties forabout 4 minutes per side, or until well done.
Top each patty with two piecesof cheese in an criss cross pattern.
Cover, and turn off the heat.
Arrange the toasted English muffins on a serving plate.
Spread the bottom halfwith a thin coating of Dijon mustard.
Place a few slices of avocado over themustard, and use a fork to mash into the nooks and crannies.
Place the beefpatties on top of the avocado, and top with a layer of green chilies.
Plop theother halves of the English muffins on top.
Serve and enjoy!
