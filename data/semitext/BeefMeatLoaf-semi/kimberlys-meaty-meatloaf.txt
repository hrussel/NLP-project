Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a mixing bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, eggs, Worcestershiresauce, onion, and parmesan cheese.
Shape into a loaf and place in a 8x4-inchloaf pan.
Top with tomato sauce.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until internal temperature measures 160degrees F (70 degrees C); the meat should be well done, with no trace of pink.
Remove from oven, and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
