Cover, and puree untilsmooth, adding more water if needed.
In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck, pork, matzo meal, and eggs.
Stir inthe onion and carrot puree a little at a time until the meat mixture holds itsshape (you may not need all the puree).
Season with garlic, salt, and blackpepper.
Shape the meat mixture into a loaf and transfer to a baking dish.
Pour thebrowning sauce and any remaining onion puree on top of the loaf.
Fill bakingdish with about 2-inches of water, then cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is no longer pink in the center, about 1hour and 20 minutes.
Remove the foil and pour ketchup in a zig-zag shape overthe loaf during the last 15 minutes of baking.
An instant-read thermometerinserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
