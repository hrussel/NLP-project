Fold each sheet of aluminum foil in half lengthwise, then fold in halflengthwise again, to make 2 strips of foil 4 inches wide by 16 inches long.
Place the strips into the bottom of a slow cooker in a cross, so that the longends of the strips come partway up the inside of the cooker (to make liftinghandles).
Spray the inside of the slow cooker and the foil strips with cookingspray.
Mix together the ground beef, pork sausage, egg whites, grits, onion powder,garlic powder, ketchup, and liquid smoke flavoring until thoroughly combined,and form into a rounded loaf.
Gently place the loaf into the slow cooker ontop of the crossed foil strips.
Cover the cooker, set on Low, and cook for 5 to 6 hours.
To serve, carefullyhold the ends of the foil strips, and gently lift the meat loaf from thecooker by the foil handles to place on a serving platter for slicing.
