Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place saltine crackers into a large, heavy plastic zipper bag, and gentlycrush into crumbs by rolling the bag with a rolling pin; alternately, placecrackers into the work bowl of a food processor and pulse briefly just tobreak into crumbs.
Two sleeves of crackers should make about 3 cups of crumbs.
Reserve 3/4 cup of crumbs; place 2 1/4 cup of crumbs into a large mixing bowl.
Mix the 2 1/4 cups of cracker crumbs in the mixing bowl with ground beef,Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, mustard, black pepper, soda, rosemary,cayenne pepper, cinnamon, garlic powder, dill relish, sweet relish, egg, self-rising flour, tomato sauce, and onion until thoroughly combined.
Form into aloaf, and place into a 9x12-inch baking dish.
Top the loaf with the reservedcracker crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until the loaf is browned, no longer pink inside,and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes to 1 hour, checking after 45minutes.
An instant-read meat thermometer, inserted into the thickest part ofthe loaf, should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
