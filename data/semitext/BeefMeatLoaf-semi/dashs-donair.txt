If you want the smooth texture of meat that you see in a realdonair shop, you must do this in a steel mixing bowl and on a sturdy surface.
Pick up the meat, and throw it down with force about 20 times, kneading itafter each throw.
This also helps the meat hold together better when you sliceit.
Form the meat into a loaf, and place it on a broiler pan.

Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, turning the loaf overabout half way through.
This will ensure even cooking.
