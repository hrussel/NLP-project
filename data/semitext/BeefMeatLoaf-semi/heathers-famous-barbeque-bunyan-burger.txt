Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
When hot, lightly oil grate.
Mix together the ground beef, 2 tablespoons barbeque seasoning, and chipotlepeppers in adobo sauce in a bowl; divide mixture into two halves; form eachhalf into large rectangles, making one larger and thinner than the other; laythe rectangles on large sheets of aluminum foil.
Mix together the cream cheese and 1 teaspoon barbeque seasoning; spread on topof the smaller, thicker rectangle of meat.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.
Cook the onion, bellpepper, mushrooms, and garlic in the hot butter until the onion has softened;spread atop the cream cheese mixture; top with the Cheddar cheese.
Place the thinner rectangle of meat atop the smaller piece by lifting thealuminum foil beneath it and flipping it onto the cream cheese and vegetablelayer.
Use your hands to form a seal around the edges of the loaf, making surethe cheese and vegetable mixture will not leak out during cooking.
Fold theedges of the aluminum foil beneath the loaf upwards, so as to form a bowl, tokeep the grease from leaking onto the grill while cooking.
Brush the top ofthe loaf with barbeque sauce.
Cook on the preheated grill until the top of the loaf is cooked completelythrough, about 30 minutes.
Slice into six even pieces to serve.
