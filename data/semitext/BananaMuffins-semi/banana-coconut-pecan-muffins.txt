Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line muffin pans with muffin/cupcake liners.
You can also lightly spray the pan if you don't have liners.
In a small bowl,combine flour, baking soda and salt.
Stir and set aside.
In a larger bowl, mixsugar and oil together then add mashed bananas.
Note: I didn't want to dirtyanother bowl so I peeled each banana and squished them individually with myclean hands right into the bowl.
This 'technique' makes for a chunkier bananaconsistency, which I like for a breakfast muffin.
If you do not like that,mash the bananas in a separate bowl then add to the sugar/oil mixture.
To your wet mix also add coconut milk and vanilla, stirring until everythingis thoroughly combined.
Add flour mixture to wet mixture and stir lightly,then add pecans and coconut.
Stir until everything is just combined.
Note: thebatter will be fairly thick.
Spoon batter into muffin tins about 3/4 full.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until muffins are golden brown on top.
