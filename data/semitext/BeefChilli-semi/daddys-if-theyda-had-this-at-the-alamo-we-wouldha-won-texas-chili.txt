Melt the bacon drippings in a large heavy pot over medium heat.
Add the onionsand cook until they are translucent.
Combine the beef with the garlic, ground chile, chili powder and cumin.
Addthis meat-and-spices to the onions in the pot.
Break up any meat that stickstogether as you cook, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes, until meat isevenly browned (very browned, not just gray).
Sprinkle in Hungarian paprikaand oregano.
Pour in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, salt, parsley and jalapeno.
Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour.
NOTE:True Texans DO NOT add beans to their chili, but my husband loves them, sothis is the point where you can add as many cans of drained and rinsed pintobeans as you wish (I add 2 cans, but shhhhhh don't tell my Daddy!!!).
During cooking you may squeeze the jalapeno as it softens against the sides ofthe pot to release more heat if desired.
Mix in the masa harina, and cook while stirring for 30 minutes longer, oruntil desired consistency is achieved.
Taste and adjust seasonings.
