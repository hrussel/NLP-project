Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
Add pasta, and cook untiltender, about 8 minutes.
Add broccoli florets and asparagus to the boilingwater during the last 5 minutes.
Drain, and run under cold water to cool.
In a large serving bowl, stir together the diced chicken, kidney beans, blackolives, green pepper, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese and Italian dressing.
Stirin the pasta, broccoli and asparagus.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Ilike it pretty heavy on the pepper.
This salad is best if chilled for a coupleof hours before serving.
