While boiling chicken, make the mayonnaise: Using a blender or hand-heldelectric mixer, beat the egg, mustard, salt, water and vinegar until light andfrothy.
Add the oil a tablespoon at a time, beating thoroughly after eachaddition.
Once mixture begins to thicken, you can add oil more quickly.
Continue until mixture reaches the consistency of creamy mayonnaise.
NOTE: Themore oil you add, the thicker it gets; you may not need the full cup of oil.
In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, grapes, pecans, blue cheese and 1cup of the mayonnaise.
