To prepare the Chinese rice noodles, heat a skillet with a few tablespoons ofoil and break off a little bit of the noodles and add them to the skillet andfry them.
They will puff up in the skillet, so only add a few at a time.
Asthey begin to puff up, remove and drain them on paper towels.
Be sure to cooklong enough as the under cooked noodles will be like eating needles.
Oncecooked, add them to the salad mixture.
In a large bowl combine the iceberg lettuce, cooked and shredded chicken,green onions and toasted sesame seeds.
Let chill about 10 minutes, and justbefore serving add the cooked rice noodles.
Serve in salad bowls and offer thedressing in a pourable container so your family can add as much dressing asthey want.
You can also pour the dressing over the top of the salad, toss, andserve immediately.
