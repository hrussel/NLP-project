Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat; lightly oil the grill.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
Cookthe pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but is stillfirm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Drain well.
While pasta is cooking, grill the chicken breast halves until the meat is nolonger pink in the middle and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chickenbreast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Allow to rest for about 5minutes, then slice into bite-size pieces; keep warm.
In a large salad bowl, lightly toss together the grilled chicken, hot cookedlinguine, romaine, green pepper, red onion, and cucumber.
In a separate bowl, whisk together safflower oil, cider vinegar, sugar, poppyseeds, dry mustard powder, and green onions until smooth and evenly blended.
Pour the dressing over the salad to serve.
