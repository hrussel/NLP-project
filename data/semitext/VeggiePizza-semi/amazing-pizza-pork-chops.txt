Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
Season the pork chops with salt and black pepper and arrange in the bottom ofa disposable aluminum pan; top each with a tomato slice.
Divide the basil,oregano, and garlic between the pork chops; drizzle with the olive oil.
Coverthe pan with aluminum foil.
Cook on the preheated grill until the pork is no longer pink in the center,about 25 minutes.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center shouldread 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Remove the pan from the grill; top eachpork chop with a slice of mozzarella cheese, replace the aluminum foil overthe pan, and wait until the cheese melts, 3 to 5 minutes, before serving.
