Steps

Divide the ground beef into three even portions. Season each one with some hot
pepper sauce. I ball up the meat, and poke my finger into it, then fill the
hole with hot sauce. Flatten into patties just a little larger than the
English muffins.

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cover, and cook the beef patties for
about 4 minutes per side, or until well done. Top each patty with two pieces
of cheese in an criss cross pattern. Cover, and turn off the heat.

Arrange the toasted English muffins on a serving plate. Spread the bottom half
with a thin coating of Dijon mustard. Place a few slices of avocado over the
mustard, and use a fork to mash into the nooks and crannies. Place the beef
patties on top of the avocado, and top with a layer of green chilies. Plop the
other halves of the English muffins on top. Serve and enjoy!
