Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix ground beef, onion, bell pepper, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, Worcestershire
sauce, sour cream, and crackers together in a bowl. Place mixture on a baking
dish and shape into a loaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 35 to 40
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Heat the cream of mushroom soup, milk, and 1 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese in a
saucepan over medium heat until the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. Pour
sauce over the meatloaf before serving.
