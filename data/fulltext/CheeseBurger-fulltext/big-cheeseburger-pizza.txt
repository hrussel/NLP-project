Steps

Place the ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook,
stirring to crumble, until evenly browned. Season with seasoning salt, drain
off grease, and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread salad dressing on
the pizza crust. Top with a layer of ground beef and onion. Sprinkle shredded
cheese over the top.

Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted. Allow
pizza to cool for about 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and top with lettuce
tomato and pickles, if desired.
