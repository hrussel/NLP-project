Steps

Combine the ground beef, pickles, onion, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, ketchup,
garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 4 patties.

Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the hamburger patties
in the hot oil until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of
doneness, 8 to 10 minutes for well done.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside. Cover a flat surface
with the flour. Divide the bread dough into 4 even pieces; roll each piece
into a flattened rectangle on the floured surface at least twice the size of
the American cheese slices. Place one slice of American cheese on each piece
of dough; top each with one of the cooked patties and another slice of
American cheese. Fold the dough over the top of the meat and cheese. Pinch the
dough around the edges to seal completely. Arrange on the prepared baking
sheet with the seam side facing downward. Brush the tops with the melted
butter; move to a warm area and allow to rise for 20 minutes.

Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Bake in the preheated oven until the bread has browned, about 20 minutes.
