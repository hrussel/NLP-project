Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, salt, and
pepper in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes;
drain and discard grease.

Mix ketchup and mustard in a bowl; spread mixture over pizza crust. Spread
mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese over ketchup mixture and top with beef
and onions. Transfer pizza to a large baking sheet.

Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes. Top with
pickles and allow pizza to cool for 5 minutes. Top with shredded lettuce and
tomatoes before slicing and serving.
