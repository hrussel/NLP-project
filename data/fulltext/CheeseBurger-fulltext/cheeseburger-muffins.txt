Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper
cups and lightly coat with cooking spray.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in
the hot skillet until the beef is completely browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
minutes; drain and discard grease.

Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir
ketchup, milk, butter, eggs, and mustard together in a separate bowl; add to
flour mixture and stir until pink in color. Mix ground beef mixture into the
flour mixture; spoon into prepared muffin cups to completely filled.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes
out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing
to cool completely on a wire rack.
