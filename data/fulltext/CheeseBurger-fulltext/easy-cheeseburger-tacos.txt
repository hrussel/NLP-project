Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch
baking dish.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef with black
pepper, salt, and garlic powder in the hot skillet until meat is browned and
crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Reduce heat to low and mix
1/2 cup ketchup into beef.

Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and place about 1/3 cup beef mixture and
1/4 cup shredded cheese onto tortilla in a line down the center. Roll tortilla
over meat and cheese, fold in top and bottom to enclose filling, and finish
rolling into a burrito shape. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
Place filled tortillas into prepared baking sheet and sprinkle remaining
Mexican cheese blend on top. Cover dish with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven until dish is heated through and cheese topping has
melted, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir sour cream with 1/3 cup ketchup in a bowl and
top each serving with the sour cream sauce.
