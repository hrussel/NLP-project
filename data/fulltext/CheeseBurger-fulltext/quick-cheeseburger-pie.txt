Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

To Make Pat-in-Pan Pastry: In a medium bowl, mix 1 1/3 cups flour and 1/2
teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles tiny peas. Add cold
water 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring with a fork after each addition. Mix
lightly just until pastry almost cleans sides of bowl. Pat into bottom and
sides of an 8 inch pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.

To Make Filling: Crumble ground beef into a large skillet and saute over
medium heat for 1 minute. Add onion and garlic. Continue to saute until onion
is browned, about 10 minutes. Drain grease from mixture.

Sprinkle beef mixture with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup flour. Stir in pickle
liquid, milk, pickles, and 1 cup shredded cheese. Spoon mixture into pastry
shell.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle top with remaining 1 cup
cheese and bake an additional 5 minutes, until pastry is golden brown and
cheese is bubbly.
