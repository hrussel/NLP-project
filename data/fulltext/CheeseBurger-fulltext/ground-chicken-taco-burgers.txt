Steps

Preheat outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grill grate, and place
about 4 inches from heat source.

Mix the ground chicken, onion, garlic, taco seasoning, and egg together in a
bowl until thoroughly blended. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide
chicken mixture evenly and form into 4 soft patties.

Cook the chicken patties on the preheated grill until meat is no longer pink
and juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on thickness. To
serve, place each patty on one half of a hamburger bun, top with a slice of
cheese, avocado slices, and desired amounts of jalapeno peppers and salsa.
Cover with remaining half of bun.
