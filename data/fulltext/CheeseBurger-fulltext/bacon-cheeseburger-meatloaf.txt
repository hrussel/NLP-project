bacon-cheeseburger-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices
on paper towels. When cool, crumble into a large bowl.

Mix ketchup and mustard in a bowl.

Thoroughly combine 1/4 the ketchup mixture, ground chuck, Cheddar cheese,
eggs, bread crumbs, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper
with crumbled bacon in bowl; pat the mixture into a 5x9-inch loaf pan. Spread
remaining ketchup mixture evenly over top of meatloaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until the meatloaf is no longer pink inside, about
45 minutes. Spread French-fried onions over the top of the loaf and return to
oven until onions are browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted
into the center of the loaf reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 10 to
15 more minutes.
