Steps

Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground
turkey. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no
longer pink. Place the browned turkey, kidney beans, and diced onion in a slow
cooker; mix well.

Combine the tomato sauce, fire roasted tomatoes, chili seasoning, ketchup,
mustard, and brown sugar in the skillet. Bring to a simmer. Stir the sauce
into the meat mixture in the slow cooker. Cook on High for 20 minutes.
Sprinkle with shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese before serving.
