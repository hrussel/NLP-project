Steps

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sweet onion and
garlic in the hot oil until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Break ground
beef into the skillet; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes
more.

Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic
powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper into the beef mixture. Pour cheese
spread into the skillet; cook and stir until the cheese spread is melted
evenly through the beef mixture, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer beef mixture to a
serving dish.

Layer lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles atop the beef mixture to serve.
