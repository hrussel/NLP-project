Steps

In medium bowl, stir together mayonnaise, 1 tbsp. chipotle sauce, 1 tsp.
garlic, cilantro and adobo; cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

In large bowl, gently mix together beef, chopped chipotle, 3 tbsp. chipotle
sauce, remaining garlic and adobo until combined. Divide meat into 6 portions;
form into 1 inch-thick patties. (Take care not to over-handle meat or else it
will toughen).

Prepare grill to medium-high heat, grease with oil (or heat oil in medium
skillet over medium-high heat). Cook burgers, flipping once, until charred and
cooked to desired doneness (about 12 minutes total for medium rare). Add
cheese to patties about 5 minutes before taking them off grill.

To assemble, divide patties evenly among bottom buns; top with onion slice,
tomato slice, lettuce and top bun spread with reserved chipotle mayonnaise.
