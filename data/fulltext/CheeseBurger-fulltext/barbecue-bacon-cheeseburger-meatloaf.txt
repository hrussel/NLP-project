Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 5x9-inch loaf pan.

Mix ground beef, 1/2 cup barbeque sauce, milk, egg, bacon bits, Worcestershire
sauce, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; stir in bread crumbs to desired
consistency. Place half the ground beef mixture into the prepared loaf pan and
press an indentation into the meat mixture, leaving a 1-inch rim of meat all
around the indentation. Fill the indentation with processed cheese and top
with remaining meat mixture. Press lightly to seal. Brush 2 tablespoons
barbeque sauce over the meatloaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear and an instant-read meat
thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads at least 160 degrees F
(70 degrees C), 60 to 80 minutes.
