Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees C (165 degrees C).

Place carrots, potato, celery, pepper, and garlic into a food processor, and
puree to a wet paste. Add eggs, mustard, and tomato paste, and process for
another few seconds.

Place the ground beef in a large mixing bowl, and add pureed vegetable
mixture, thyme, basil, rosemary, cayenne pepper, and salt and pepper. Knead
together until thoroughly mixed. Form into two loaves, and place in a 9x13
inch baking dish.

Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until done. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before
slicing. You can also press the meat into bread pans to cook.
