cheeseburger-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large bowl, combine the beef, bread crumbs, onion, eggs, salt and pepper,
and mix well. Pat out meat mixture into a 14x18 inch rectangle on a piece of
wax paper. Spread cheese over the meat, leaving a 3/4 inch border around the
edges. Roll up jelly roll fashion to enclose the filling and form a pinwheel
loaf. Press beef in on both ends to enclose the cheese. Place in a 10x15 inch
baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until internal temperature reaches 160
degrees F (70 degrees C).
