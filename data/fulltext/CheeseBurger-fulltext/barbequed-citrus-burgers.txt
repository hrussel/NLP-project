Steps

Grate the zest from the lemon, lime, and orange into a large bowl. Squeeze the
juice from half of each piece of fruit into the bowl. Whisk in 1 tablespoon
barbeque sauce. Stir in ground beef; mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 10 to
30 minutes.

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.

Form meat into patties. Grill with lid open, about 3 minutes per side. Brush
each burger with one tablespoon barbeque sauce during grilling, coating both
sides. Top burgers with pepperjack cheese and cook until cheese is melted and
meat is no longer pink in the center, about 1 additional minute.
