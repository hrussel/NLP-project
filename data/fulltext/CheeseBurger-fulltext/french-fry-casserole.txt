Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and grease a 9x13 inch baking
dish.

Heat the oil in a skillet, and cook and stir the ground beef, onion, and green
pepper over medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the meat is crumbly and no
longer pink and the onion is translucent. Season with salt and pepper to
taste, and stir in the condensed mushroom soup. Bring the mixture to a simmer
over medium-low heat.

Scoop the cheese sauce into a microwaveable bowl, and melt on low power for
about 30 seconds.

Place the ground beef mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish, and
spread an even layer of the melted cheese sauce over the ground beef. Top with
frozen shoestring fries. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes,
until the fries are starting to turn golden.
