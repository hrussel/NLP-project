Steps

Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a plate
lined with paper towels, reserving drippings in the skillet.

Break ground beef into the skillet; cook and stir until completely browned, 5
to 7 minutes. Drain beef, return skillet to stove, and reduce heat to low.

Stir diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, cream cheese, and shredded
Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend into ground beef. Crumble bacon and stir
most of it, reserving a few teaspoons for garnish, into beef mixture; cook and
stir until cheese begins to melt, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a slow cooker.

Cook in slow cooker on Low until hot and bubbly, 2 to 3 hours. Stir parsley
into the dip. Garnish with reserved bacon. Keep in the slow cooker set to Low
to serve.
