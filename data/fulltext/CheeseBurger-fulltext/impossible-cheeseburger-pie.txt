Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a deep-dish 9-inch pie
dish.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in
hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard
grease. Spread ground beef mixture into the prepared pie dish.

Blend milk, baking mix, eggs, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper together in
a blender until smooth, about 15 seconds; pour over beef mixture.

Bake in the preheated oven until biscuit topping is lightly browned, about 25
minutes. Arrange tomato slices on biscuit topping; sprinkle with Cheddar
cheese. Continue baking until cheese is melted, 5 to 8 more minutes. Cool 5
minutes before slicing.
