cheeseburger-wontons

Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot
skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.

Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon ground beef and 1/2 teaspoon Colby-Monterey Jack
cheese onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Fold each wrapper into a
triangle and seal edges together with water.

Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
The vegetable oil will be ready when bubbles form around the end of a wooden
spoon inserted in the oil.

Fry wontons in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove
wontons with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
