Steps

In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine water, potatoes, carrots, onion,
bell pepper, jalapeno and garlic. Sprinkle salt and bouillon over the mixture.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until
potatoes are tender.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef until brown; drain.

Stir cooked beef and 2 cups milk into the soup and heat through. Combine
remaining 1/2 cup milk with flour, stirring until smooth; stir into soup.
Bring to a low boil and cook, stirring, until thickened, 3 minutes.

Reduce heat to low and stir in cheese until melted. Season with cayenne.
