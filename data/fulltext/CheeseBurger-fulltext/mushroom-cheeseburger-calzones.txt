mushroom-cheeseburger-calzones

Steps

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Cook ground beef, mushrooms, sweet onion, and jalapeno pepper in a large
skillet over medium heat until the beef is browned and crumbly and the
mushrooms are softened, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and stir in
ketchup, yellow mustard, salt, and black pepper. Remove from heat.

Roll out pizza dough on a floured work surface and cut dough in half. Spoon
half the ground beef onto each dough half; top each with 6 dill pickle slices
and half the American-Cheddar cheese blend. Fold dough over to enclose filling
and press edges together with a fork to seal the calzones. Place calzones onto
a baking sheet, brush tops with olive oil, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Bake in the preheated oven until calzones are golden brown and the cheese has
melted, 15 to 20 minutes.
