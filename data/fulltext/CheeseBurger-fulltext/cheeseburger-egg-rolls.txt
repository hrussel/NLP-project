cheeseburger-egg-rolls

Steps

Place the ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and
stir for about 10 minutes, breaking up the beef into crumbles as it cooks.
Drain the meat and transfer to a bowl. Stir in the chopped pickles, shredded
cheese, and mustard, and mix together well.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a bowl of water next to your
work surface. Remove an egg roll wrapper from the stack, and cover the
remaining wrappers with a damp paper towel to prevent them from drying out.

Place the wrapper on the work surface with a corner facing towards you. Place
about 1/4 cup of filling on the wrapper, and fold the top corner down over the
filling. Tightly roll the wrapper into a cylinder, tucking in the corners as
you roll, until the wrapper completely encloses the filling. Moisten the last
corner with a little water, and finish wrapping so the moistened corner
tightly seals to the egg roll, and there are no gaps to let the filling leak
out. Place filled egg rolls on the parchment-lined baking sheet, covered with
a slightly damp paper towel, while you finish making the egg rolls.

Heat the oil in a deep saucepan or deep fryer until a thermometer registers
365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Carefully place 2 or 3 egg rolls at a time into
the hot oil, and fry for about 4 or 5 minutes, turning the egg rolls over
once, until golden brown. Remove the egg rolls with a tongs, and drain on
paper towels.
