Steps

Mix ground beef with seasoning mix in large bowl until well blended. Shape
beef into 6 oblong patties, about 6 x 3-inches each. Whisk together barbecue
sauce and dressing in small bowl; set aside.

Spray grate of outdoor grill and utensils with grilling spray. Preheat grill
to medium heat. Grill patties 5 minutes on one side or until juices begin to
appear on surface. Turn patties over; top each with 3 slices bacon. Cook about
4 minutes longer; top each patty with 2 triangle pieces of cheese, overlapping
to cover patty. Remove patties when cheese begins to melt.

Spread barbecue-dressing mixture on bottom of each roll. Add a lettuce leaf.
Place cooked patty with bacon and cheese on lettuce. Spoon additional
barbecue-dressing mixture over cheese. Sprinkle with fried onions, if desired.
Serve immediately.
