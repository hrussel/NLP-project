Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to
crumble, until no longer pink. Add the onion to the skillet; cook and stir
until tender. Drain off grease.

Unroll the crescent roll dough on a clean surface. Separate the triangles and
then cut each triangle in half diagonally to make 2 smaller triangles. Stack
the slices of cheese and cut diagonally into 4 triangles. Place one triangle
of cheese onto each triangle of dough. Spoon about a tablespoon of ground beef
over the cheese and then top with a slice of pickle. Fold the points of the
dough towards the center like a diaper and place on a baking sheet.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
