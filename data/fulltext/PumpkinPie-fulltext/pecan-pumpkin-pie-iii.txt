Steps

Place rack in upper third of oven. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
C).

To Make Pumpkin Layer: In a medium bowl combine pumpkin puree, 2 tablespoons
brown sugar, 1 egg, sour cream, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir until thoroughly
combined. Spread mixture into pie shell.

To Make Pecan Layer: In a medium bowl, combine corn syrup, 1/2 cup brown
sugar, 3 eggs, butter, vanilla, lemon rind, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well,
then stir in pecans. Carefully spoon mixture over pumpkin layer.

Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Bake an additional 20 to 30 minutes. The filling will puff
slightly, but the center will not be completely set. Allow to set for at least
an hour before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
