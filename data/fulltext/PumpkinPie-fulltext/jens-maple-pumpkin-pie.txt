Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with
parchment paper.

Place pumpkin halves, cut-side down, on prepared baking sheet.

Roast pumpkin in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Set aside
until cool enough to handle, at least 15 minutes. Remove seeds from pumpkin
and discard. Scoop pumpkin flesh into a food processor and blend until smooth.
Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

While pumpkin is roasting, roll out pie dough to fit in a 9-inch pie dish.
Crimp edges to form a border. Refrigerate dough until chilled, at least 45
minutes.

Line chilled pie dough with 2 sheets of aluminum foil and pour pie weights
into the foil.

Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set on the sides and lightly golden
on the border, about 25 minutes. Remove aluminum foil with pie weights. Whisk
egg white and water together in a small bowl. Brush border of pie crust with
egg white mixture and return to oven. Bake until bottom of the pie appears dry
and set, about 10 minutes more. Remove crust from oven and reduce temperature
to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

Whisk 2 cups pumpkin puree, cream, eggs, brown sugar, maple syrup, flour,
vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.
Pour pumpkin mixture into baked pie crust.

Bake pie in the preheated oven until just set in the center, about 50 minutes.
