Steps

Heat a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat.

Whisk eggs, half and half, pumpkin, cinnamon, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie
spice, and walnuts together in a bowl. Soak one slice of bread at a time in
the pumpkin mixture, then place in the prepared skilled. Repeat with the
remaining slices of bread. Stir the pumpkin mixture between dips to keep the
walnuts from settling. Cook the bread until golden brown, about 3 minutes on
each side.
