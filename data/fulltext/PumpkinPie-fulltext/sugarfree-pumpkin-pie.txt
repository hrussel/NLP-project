Steps

In a large saucepan, combine gelatin, cornstarch, spices and salt. Stir in
pumpkin and evaporated milk. Let stand for 5 minutes to soften gelatin. Cook
and stir over medium heat until mixture bubbles; cook and stir for 2 minutes
after bubbling. Remove from heat.

In a medium bowl, gradually stir about 1 cup of cooked mixture into beaten
eggs. Return to remaining mixture in saucepan and cook over low heat for 2
minutes; do not boil. Remove from heat and stir in artificial sweetener after
filing has cooled to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).

Pour mixture into pie crust; cover and chill for 6 hours or overnight. Serve
with whipped cream if desired.
