plate. Place 8 inch pie plate on top and bake 8 minutes. Remove top plate and
set aside to cool.

In a saucepan, combine gelatin, 2/3 cup brown sugar, salt, 1/2 teaspoon
cinnamon, ginger and mace. Stir in egg yolks and milk. Bring to a boil and
cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in pumpkin
puree. Chill until firm.

In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually
add cream of tartar and 1/3 cup white sugar, continuing to beat until stiff
peaks form. Fold into pumpkin mixture. Pour filling into pie crust. Chill in
