Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Make the pastry dough by creaming together 12 ounces of cream cheese with 1
pound of butter and the sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly blended. Mix in
the flour, a little at a time, until the dough is workable. Cut the dough into
4 equal-sized pieces, roll the pieces into balls, and refrigerate until
needed.

To make the filling, mash 12 ounces of cream cheese with brown sugar, pumpkin
pie spice, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl until smooth and well combined; beat
in eggs, one at a time, incorporating each egg before adding the next one. Mix
in the pumpkin, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract until the filling is
smooth.

Cut each dough ball in half, and cut each half into 12 pieces (96 total
pieces). Working in batches, press each small piece of dough into the bottom
and up the sides of mini muffin cups. Fill the little crusts almost to the top
with the pumpkin filling. Refrigerate unused dough until you need it to make
the next batch.

Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is set and the crusts are lightly
golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool completely before frosting.

Mash 1/2 cup of butter, the shortening, and 8 ounces of cream cheese together
in a bowl until thoroughly combined, and mix in the confectioners' sugar and
marshmallow creme until smooth and creamy. Spread or pipe the frosting onto
the cooled tarts. Sprinkle each tart with a few chopped pecans. Refrigerate
until serving.
