Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter in a mixing bowl until
evenly moistened; press into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is lightly browned and smells
toasted, about 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

Spread 1/4 cup caramel topping onto the cooled crust. Sprinkle 1/2 cup pecan
pieces over the caramel topping.

Whisk milk, pumpkin, pudding mix, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl
until well combined. Stir 1 1/2 cups whipped topping into pumpkin mixture.
Spread pumpkin mixture into crust. Spread remaining whipped topping over the
top of the pie. Refrigerate pie until chilled, at least 1 hour. Sprinkle 2
tablespoons pecans atop the pie and drizzle with 2 tablespoons caramel using a
fork.
