Steps

Preheat an oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Coat 2 baking sheets with
nonstick cooking spray.

Combine brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, rolled oats, almonds, and pecans in a
large bowl. Mix the applesauce, honey, and vanilla in a separate large bowl.
Stir the oat mixture into the applesauce mixture, until granola begins to
gather in clusters. Spoon granola evenly onto prepared baking sheets.

Bake in preheated oven, stirring every 20 minutes, until lightly browned and
crispy, about 1 hour.

Remove from oven; cool to room temperature. Stir in raisins and cranberries;
store in an airtight container.
