pumpkin-pie-ice-cream

Steps

Mix pumpkin puree, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl.
Slowly whisk in milk, then whipping cream, then vanilla extract. Refrigerate
to allow flavors to blend, 2 hours to overnight.

Transfer pumpkin mixture into an ice cream maker; churn for 15 to 20 minutes.
Freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches 'soft-serve'
consistency. Transfer ice cream to a lidded plastic container; cover surface
with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should 'bloom' in the
freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.
