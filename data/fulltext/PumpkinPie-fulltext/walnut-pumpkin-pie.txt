Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

In a mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin, condensed milk, egg, 3/4 teaspoon
cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt. Pour batter into the pie crust.

Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature
to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, flour, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon
cinnamon. Cut in the butter or margarine until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in
walnuts. Sprinkle mixture evenly over the pie. Bake pie for 40 minutes or

garnish as desired.
