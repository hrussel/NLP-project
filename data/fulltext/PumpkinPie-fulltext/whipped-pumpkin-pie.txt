Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Combine graham cracker crumbs, 2/3 cup sugar, and melted butter in a mixing
bowl. Mix until evenly moistened, then press into the bottom and halfway up
the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Place pan on a baking sheet.

Bake the crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned and toasted, about
10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow crust to cool.

Beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar together in a large bowl with an electric
mixture until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in pumpkin puree until
completely incorporated.

Fold whipped topping into pumpkin mixture; stir in nutmeg and pumpkin pie
spice. Pour pumpkin mixture into graham cracker crust. Cover pie with plastic
wrap and refrigerate overnight. Gently remove pie from springform pan.
