Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

To Make Pastry: In a large bowl, mix together flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 2
teaspoons salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal.

In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, 1 egg, and ice water. Pour into flour
mixture and stir until dough forms a ball. Divide into 4 portions. Freeze 3 of
them or use for other pies. Reserve one for Pilgrim Pumpkin Pie.

To Make Pumpkin Filling: In a large bowl, combine 2 beaten eggs, pumpkin, 3/4
cup honey or sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, cloves,
and evaporated milk. Mix well.

Roll out pastry and fit into a 9 inch pie plate. Pour in pumpkin filling.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Bake an additional 45 minutes, until filling is set.

To Make Honey Ginger Cream: In a large bowl combine whipping cream, 1/4 cup
honey, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger. Whip until soft peaks form. Chill 1 hour
before serving. Place a spoonful on top of each slice of pie.
