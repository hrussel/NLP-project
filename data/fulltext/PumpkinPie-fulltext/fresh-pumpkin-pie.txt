Steps

Cut pumpkin in half, and remove seeds. Lightly oil the cut surface. Place cut
side down on a jelly roll pan lined with foil and lightly oiled. Bake at 325
degrees F (165 degrees C) until the flesh is tender when poked with a fork.
Cool until just warm. Scrape the pumpkin flesh from the peel. Either mash, or
puree in small batches in a blender.

In large bowl, blend together 2 cups pumpkin puree, spices, and salt. Beat in
eggs, honey, milk, and cream. Pour filling into pie shell.

Bake at 400 degrees F ( 205 degrees C) for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a knife
inserted 1 inch from edge of pie comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
