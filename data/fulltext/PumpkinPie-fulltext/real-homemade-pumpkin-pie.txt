Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Cut out top of pumpkin and clean out all seeds and strings from inside. Slice
pumpkin vertically into 3 inch wide strips. Place strips onto a baking sheet.

Bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour. Once done, scrape the pumpkin from
the skins, then beat with a mixer or puree in a food processor until smooth.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Mix the nutmeg, ginger, salt, evaporated milk and eggs with the pumpkin puree.
Pour mixture into two 9 inch pie crusts.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees
F (175 degrees C) and bake for an additional 35 to 40 minutes, or until
