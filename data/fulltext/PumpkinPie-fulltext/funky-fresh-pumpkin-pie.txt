Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch
pie pan.

Whisk pumpkin, sweetened condensed milk, and eggs together in a bowl until
smooth, about 30 seconds. Add light brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger;
whisk until evenly combined. Pour mixture into prepared pie crust. Sprinkle
pecans over filling.

Place pie on a baking sheet and cover pie with a sheet of aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C) and remove aluminum foil. Roll aluminum foil into a flattened
tube-shape and cover crust with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove
aluminum foil and bake until pie is set in the middle and crust is lightly
browned, about 5 more minutes.
