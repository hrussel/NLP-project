Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Whisk sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves together in a small bowl. Beat
eggs together in a large bowl; stir in pumpkin and sugar mixture until just
combined. Slowly pour evaporated milk into pumpkin mixture and stir until
combined.

Arrange peanut butter cups, up-side down, into the graham cracker crust. Pour
pumpkin mixture over peanut butter cups in pie crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted in the center of
the pie comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack,
about 2 hours. Serve immediately or refrigerate.
