Steps

Cut pumpkin into halves and remove seeds. Cut seeded pumpkin into 3-inch
chunks.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pumpkin in boiling water until
tender, about 20 minutes; drain. Set pumpkin aside to cool until the skin
hardens and the flesh is cool enough to handle.

Scrape pumpkin flesh from skin into a large bowl; transfer to a food processor
and blend until smooth. Put pureed pumpkin into a fine mesh strainer set over
a bowl and set aside to drain.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Press pie crusts into pie pans. Trim dough to overlap edges of pans by about
1/4 inch.

Dip a fork into the egg white first and then into the sugar. Put the tines
onto the rim of your pie crust and press down, leaving little ridges that will
brown when they are cooked.

Bake pie crust in preheated oven until slightly set, about 5 minutes. Place
pie pans onto a cookie sheet.

Beat drained pumpkin, evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger,
nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl; pour into the prepared crusts. Fold
strips of aluminum foil around the edges of the crusts.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C).

Continue baking pie until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
clean, about 40 minutes. Allow to cool 30 minutes before serving.
