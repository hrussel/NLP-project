Steps

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

In a large bowl, mix together the pumpkin, sweetened condensed milk, and egg
yolks. Stir in 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. In a large glass
or metal bowl, whip egg whites until soft peaks form. Gently fold into pumpkin
mixture. Pour filling into pie shell.

Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. While the pie is baking, prepare
the streusel topping: In a small bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, and 1
teaspoon cinnamon. Blend in the cold butter with a fork or pastry blender
until the mixture is crumbly. Mix in the chopped nuts. Sprinkle the topping
over the pie.

Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake an additional 40
minutes, or until set.
