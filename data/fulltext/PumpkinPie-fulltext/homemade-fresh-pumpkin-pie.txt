Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt. Cut shortening into
flour, add 1 tablespoon water to mixture at a time. Mix dough and repeat until
dough is moist enough to hold together.

With lightly floured hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board
roll dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch
larger than the upside down 8 to 9 inch pie pan. Gently roll the dough around
the rolling pin and transfer it right side up on to the pie pan. Unroll, ease
dough into the bottom of the pie pan.

In a large bowl with mixer speed on medium, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk,
eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt. Mix well. Pour into a
prepared crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from
the edge comes out clean.
