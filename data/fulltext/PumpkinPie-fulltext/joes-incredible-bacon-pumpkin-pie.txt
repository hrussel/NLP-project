Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil; add the pumpkin and cook until
soft enough to easily pierce with a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain.

Mash the cooked pumpkin with a potato masher in your favorite large bowl. Mix
the cream cheese and brown sugar with the mashed pumpkin. Whisk in the eggs
one at a time. Add the vanilla, half-and-half, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and
cloves; stir until you have a thin batter. The batter should be slightly
thinner than pancake batter. Pour the batter into the pie crusts.

Place bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until evenly brown. Trim soft,
fatty bits from strips. Press 7 pieces of bacon into the batter of each pie
with a fork.

Bake the pies in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Decrease the heat to 375
degrees F (190 degrees C). Top each pie with 2 pieces of cooked bacon and bake
another 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Allow pies to cool completely before serving.
