Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

To Make Cheesecake Layer: In a small mixing bowl, beat softened cream cheese
until fluffy. Mix in 1/4 cup white sugar. Add 1 egg and vanilla extract. Stir
until mixture is smooth. Pour mixture into pastry shell.

To Make Pumpkin Layer: In a medium bowl, combine pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup white
sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt, evaporated milk, and 2 beaten eggs. Mix
thoroughly, then pour mixture over cheesecake layer.

Bake in preheated oven for 65 minutes, until set in center. Remove pie and
turn oven to broiler setting.

To Make Pecan Topping: In a small bowl, mix together softened butter or
margarine, brown sugar, and chopped pecans. Gently drop mixture by
teaspoonfuls over pie, covering top evenly.

Broil 5 inches below oven coils until mixture begins to bubble, about 3
minutes. Do not overcook, or top will become syrupy. Cool before serving.
