Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Grease a rimmed baking sheet.

Heat pumpkin puree in a skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until
most of the liquid has evaporated and puree is thick. Stir in sugar, raisins,
semolina, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Remove from heat.

Lay one puff pastry sheet into the prepared baking sheet. Spread the pumpkin
mixture over the pastry and cover with the remaining pastry sheet. Brush the
top of the puff pastry with beaten egg.

Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.
