Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place pumpkin halves cut side
down on a medium baking sheet, and cover with foil. Bake 90 minutes, or until
flesh is easily mashed with a fork. Cool, scoop pumpkin flesh from shell, and
mash.

Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

In a medium bowl, mix mashed pumpkin, honey, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg,
and salt. Gradually blend in heavy cream and eggs. Pour into crusts, and top
with pecans.

Bake pies in the preheated oven 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the
center comes out clean.
