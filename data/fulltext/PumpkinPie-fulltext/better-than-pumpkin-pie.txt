Steps

Place squash in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and
simmer over medium heat until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, and cool.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a blender or food processor, combine butternut squash, brown sugar,
cornstarch, egg, milk, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg. Process
until smooth. Pour into the unbaked pie shell.

Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes, or until a table knife comes out clean
when inserted in the center.
