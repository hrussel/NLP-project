Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Whisk together the eggs, pumpkin, milk, brown sugar, brandy, salt, cinnamon,
ginger, cloves, and nutmeg in a large bowl until smooth. Pour the mixture into
the pie crusts. Cover the outside edge of each pie with aluminum foil.

Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes; remove foil. Continue to bake until a
knife inserted near the center of a pie comes out clean, about 25 minutes
more.

Cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Store unused portion in
refrigerator.
