Steps

Beat cream cheese, egg yolk, and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl until
smooth. Pour melted butter into a separate shallow bowl. Mix remaining 3/4 cup
sugar and cinnamon together in a third shallow bowl.

Spread even amounts of the cream cheese mixture onto one side of each bread
slice. Roll the bread into a cylinder around the cream cheese filling. Brush
melted butter around the outside of each cylinder and roll the cylinders in
the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat.

Arrange the rolls in a dish, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for at least
2 hours.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Transfer frozen rolls to a baking dish and bake in preheated oven until hot in
the center, 10 to 12 minutes.
