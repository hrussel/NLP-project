Steps

Whisk together the sweet potato, eggs, cinnamon, and nutmeg until smooth. Dip
the bread into the egg mixture on both sides for several seconds until the
bread is moist all the way through.

Heat a large, lightly-oiled skillet over medium heat. Cook the French toast in
batches until golden brown on each side and no longer wet in the center, about
4 minutes per side.
