Steps

Stir the cream cheese, almonds, brown sugar, and lemon juice together in a
bowl until the mixture is soft and thoroughly combined; spread over one side
of each bread slice. Place 1/4 of the blueberries onto a bread slice; press
down on the berries to keep them from rolling off. Top the blueberries with a
cream cheese-spread slice. Repeat 3 more times with remaining berries to make
4 blueberry sandwiches.

Beat the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl until
blended. Spray a skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat.

Dip each blueberry sandwich into the egg mixture on both sides; fry in the
prepared skillet until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
