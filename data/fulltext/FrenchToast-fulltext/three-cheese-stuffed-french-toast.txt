Steps

The night before: Split each bread slice four fifths of the way through.
Spread the two sides apart so that they look like butterfly wings. Use a fork
hollow out a shallow pocket on the inside of each slice. Discard the crumbs;
set bread aside

In a medium bowl, mix together the mozzarella, cream cheese and ricotta
cheese. Stir in the apricot jam. Spoon 2 tablespoons of cheese mixture into
each bread slice. Place slices in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover and chill 8
hours or overnight.

The next morning: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour apricot
nectar into a small saucepan and simmer over medium heat. Stir in sugar and
cornstarch; cook until thickened.

Beat together eggs and milk. Dip bread slices into egg mixture and dredge in
cornflakes crumbs. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium
heat; cook bread 2 minutes on each side or until golden. Place in a lightly
greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.

In a medium frying pan or skillet, heat 1/4 cup butter, 2 tablespoons sugar
and ginger over medium heat. Add peaches and cook for 3 minutes.

Arrange French toast slices on individual plates. Top each serving evenly with
peach slices, sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve with apricot syrup.
