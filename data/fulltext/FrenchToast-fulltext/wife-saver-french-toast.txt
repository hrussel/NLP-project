Steps

Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Stir the brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter
together in a saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbly. Pour into the
prepared baking dish, then arrange the sliced French bread evenly over the
syrup. Whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, flour, and salt until
smooth. Pour over the French bread. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the white sugar
and ground cinnamon; sprinkle over the french toast.

Bake in preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 50 minutes.
