Steps

Preheat an oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).

Combine the thawed strawberries with their juice and the blueberries in a
bowl; set aside. Beat together the softened cream cheese and confectioner's
sugar until smooth; set aside. Whisk the milk, eggs, vanilla, and cinnamon in
a shallow bowl.

Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or griddle. Dip bread into egg
mixture, coating thoroughly. Cook until well-browned on both sides, about 5
minutes. Place cooked slices on baking sheet and place in oven to keep warm
until ready to serve.

Spread the cream cheese mixture over each slice of french toast, then top with
2 tablespoons of the fruit. Serve immediately.
