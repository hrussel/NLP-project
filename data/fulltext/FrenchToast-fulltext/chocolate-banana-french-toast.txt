Steps

Whisk eggs in a large bowl until well blended. Whisk in chocolate milk and
bananas.

Dip bread slices into egg mixture; let soak briefly to coat both sides. Remove
bread, letting excess egg mixture drip back into bowl, and place in a large
lightly buttered or oiled frying pan over medium heat. Cook bread for a few
minutes on both sides until golden brown.

Serve topped with bananas and strawberries, if desired, and drizzled with
syrup. Or, spread with jam.
