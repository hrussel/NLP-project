banana-stuffed-french-toast

Steps

Create a pocket about 2/3 of the way into each slice of bread by cutting along
an edge. Fill pockets with 2 or 3 banana slices each.

In a medium bowl, beat together eggs, water, milk, vanilla extract, orange
liqueur and orange zest. Dip the bread slices in the mixture, allowing slices
to become saturated.

Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place a few slices at a time
in the skillet, and cook, turning once, until both sides are golden brown.
Dust with confectioners' sugar to serve.
