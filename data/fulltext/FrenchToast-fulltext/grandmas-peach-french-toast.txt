Steps

In a saucepan, stir together the brown sugar, butter and water. Bring to a
boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.

Pour the brown sugar mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and tilt the dish
to cover the entire bottom. Place peaches in a layer over the sugar coating,
then top with slices of French bread. In a medium bowl, whisk together the
eggs and vanilla. Slowly pour over the bread slices to coat evenly. Sprinkle
cinnamon over the top. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.

Remove the dish from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking to come
to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bread is golden
brown. Spoon out portions to serve.
