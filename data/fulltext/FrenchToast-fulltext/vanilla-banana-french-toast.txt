Steps

Beat eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar together in a bowl. Place bread into
the egg mixture to soak.

Heat a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat and brown the slices of bread on
both sides. Heat a smaller lightly oiled skillet over medium-low heat and pour
the remaining egg mixture into the skillet. Allow the eggs to set in the
skillet for 1 to 2 minutes, then continue to cook and stir eggs until
scrambled.

Place 1 slice of toast onto a plate and top with the eggs. Layer the slices of
banana over the eggs, then place the second slice of toast on top to make a
sandwich.
