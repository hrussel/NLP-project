easy-pina-colada-french-toast

Steps

Whisk together the eggs, milk, and pina colada mix in a bowl. Heat a skillet
over medium heat; melt butter in the skillet until the foam disappears. Soak
the bread slices in the egg mixture, turning the slices over a couple of
times.

Gently lay the soaked bread slices into the hot skillet 2 at a time and pan-
fry until the french toast is golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer
cooked french toast slices to a warmed platter while you finish cooking. Top
each 2-slice serving with several slices of banana to serve.
