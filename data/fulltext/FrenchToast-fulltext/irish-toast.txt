irish-toast

Steps

Cut the bread into 12 slices. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Irish
whiskey, Irish cream liqueur, and vanilla extract until well blended.

Heat some of the butter in a skillet over medium heat until the butter is hot
and the foam has disappeared. Press each bread slice into the egg mixture,
then fry in the hot skillet until nicely browned on both sides, about 2
minutes per side. Add more butter to skillet as needed. Brush each slice with
butter, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
