pineapple-stuffed-french-toast

Steps

Mix pineapple and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl. Spread each slice of bread
with 1 1/2 teaspoon cream cheese. Top 2 slices with 1/4 cup pineapple mixture
apiece; reserve remaining pineapple mixture. Place remaining slices of bread
atop pineapple mixture and press lightly to make 2 sandwiches.

Whisk remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, milk, egg, sugar, and vanilla extract
in a shallow bowl. Lay each sandwich in milk mixture and let bread absorb
mixture for a few seconds; flip and repeat.

Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat, melt butter in the hot skillet, and
fry sandwiches on both sides in butter until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per
side. Top each sandwich with half the remaining pineapple mixture and drizzle
1 tablespoon hot fudge sauce over pineapple.
