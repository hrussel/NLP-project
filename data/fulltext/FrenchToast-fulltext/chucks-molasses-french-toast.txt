Steps

Beat together the eggs, molasses, cream, vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon in a
bowl until smooth. Dip the challah slices in the batter until coated on all
sides.

Melt half of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place half of the
challah slices into the pan, and cook until golden brown on each side, about 3
minutes per side. Repeat with remaining butter and challah slices.
