Steps

In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and
cloves.

Melt about 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip
slices of bread one at a time into the egg, quickly coating each side but not
fully saturating the bread.

Fry a few slices at a time in the buttered skillet until golden brown on each
side. Add more butter to the skillet and continue with remaining slices. Melt
remaining butter in the microwave at 15 second intervals. Place finished toast
onto plates, drizzle with melted butter, and dust with confectioners' sugar.

Ingredients

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
