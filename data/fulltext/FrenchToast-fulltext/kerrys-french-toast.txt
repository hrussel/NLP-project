Steps

In a medium bowl, blend the cream cheese with brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg
and cinnamon

Spread 4 slices bread with the cream cheese mixture, and top with remaining
bread slices, creating sandwiches.

Mix eggs and milk in a shallow bowl. Dip bread into the egg and milk to coat
thoroughly.

Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Cook coated bread
slices 2 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.
