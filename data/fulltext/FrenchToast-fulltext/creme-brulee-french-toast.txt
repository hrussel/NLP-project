Steps

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Mix in brown sugar and corn
syrup, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish.

Remove crusts from bread, and arrange in the baking dish in a single layer. In
a small bowl, whisk together eggs, half and half, vanilla extract, orange
brandy, and salt. Pour over the bread. Cover, and chill at least 8 hours, or
overnight.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove the dish from the
refrigerator, and bring to room temperature.

Bake uncovered 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until puffed and
lightly browned.
