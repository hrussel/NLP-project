Steps

Place bread in a flat bottomed dish. Whisk together the eggs, milk, orange
juice, orange zest, vanilla, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a mixing
bowl. Pour egg mixture over bread, and refrigerate until bread absorbs the
liquid, about 10 minutes.

Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Place bread into
skillet. Cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side.
