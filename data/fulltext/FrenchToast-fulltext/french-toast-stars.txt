Steps

Place a slice of bread on a cutting board. Align a star-shaped cookie cutter
in the center of the slice. Push the cookie cutter through the bread, rocking
it gently back and forth. Once the cookie cutter makes it all the way through
bread, remove bread outside the cutter. Hold the cutter down on the bread
during this step to prevent the star from tearing. Use a sharp knife to trim
any bread that lingers outside the cookie cutter. Gently remove the star from
the cutter and put aside. Repeat on all slices of bread.

In a medium bowl, beat together eggs, whipping cream, honey, salt, cinnamon,
orange zest and vanilla extract.

In a griddle or frying pan, melt the butter over medium high heat.

Dip both sides of the stars in the egg mixture and carefully transfer to the
hot griddle. Brown on both sides and transfer to a warm plate while remaining
stars cook. Serve hot.
