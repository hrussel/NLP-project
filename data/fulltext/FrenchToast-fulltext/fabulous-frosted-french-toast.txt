Steps

In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and
cinnamon. Melt one tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
Dip a few bread slices into the egg mixture just to coat. Place in the hot
skillet, and cook until golden on each side, about 4 minutes per side. Repeat
with remaining slices of bread. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in the skillet
before frying each batch of toast.

While the toast is cooking, mix cream cheese, 2 tablespoons of sugar, sour
cream, and whipped topping using an electric mixer or blender until smooth,
yet firm.

Place servings of warm French toast onto plates, and top with a generous
dollop of the frosting.
