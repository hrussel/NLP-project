Steps

In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, melted butter, and corn syrup.
Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, and spread evenly. Sprinkle pecans
over the sugar mixture. Arrange the bread slices in the bottom of the dish so
they are in a snug single layer.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the orange zest, orange juice, milk, sugar,
cinnamon, vanilla, egg whites, and eggs. Pour this mixture over the bread,
pressing on the bread slices to help absorb the liquid. Cover and refrigerate
for at least one hour, or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C ). Remove the cover from the
baking dish, and let stand for 20 minutes at room temperature.

Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Dust with
confectioners' sugar before serving.
