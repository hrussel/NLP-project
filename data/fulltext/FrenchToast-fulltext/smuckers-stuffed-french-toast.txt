Steps

Heat oven to 225 degrees F. Spray griddle with no-stick cooking spray.

Blend together filling ingredients in small bowl until light and fluffy. Set
aside.

Cut bread into 10 to 12 slices, approximately 1-1/2 inch thick. Cut a small
slice along the top of each piece, creating a pocket in the middle. Fill with
a heaping tablespoon of filling.

Mix together the eggs, half-and-half, vanilla and nutmeg. Dip bread in egg
mixture and cook on prepared griddle until both sides are golden brown, being
careful to keep filling in bread pocket. Place cooked slices on baking sheet
and place in oven to keep warm.

Heat preserves in small saucepan until melted. Stir in orange juice and almond
extract. To serve, drizzle over French toast.
