Steps

Bring the red wine, orange juice, and orange zest to a boil in a small
saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 5 minutes. Pour in the maple
syrup and crushed red pepper flakes. Continue cooking 5 minutes more; reduce
heat to warm and keep the syrup hot.

Meanwhile, spread one side of each slice of bread with the softened cream
cheese. Press the blueberries into the cream cheese and sandwich two pieces of
bread together with the cream cheese on the inside to form the sandwiches; set
aside. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl; whisk in the milk until smooth.

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip the sandwiches into
the egg mixture allowing the egg to soak into the bread; allow excess egg to
drip off. Cook the sandwiches in the hot butter until golden brown on both
sides and the bread is no longer soggy, about 5 minutes per side. Serve with
the hot orange maple syrup.
