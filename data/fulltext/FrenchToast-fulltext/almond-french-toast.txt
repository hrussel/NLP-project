Steps

Place almonds in a small saucepan over low heat. Tossing frequently, toast
until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, flour, salt, baking powder, almond
extract and vanilla extract. Soak bread slices in the mixture until saturated.
Place slices in a shallow pan. Refrigerate slices approximately 1 hour.

Heat canola oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. One at a time,
press one side of soaked bread slices in the almonds to coat. Fry bread slices
on both sides until golden brown. Dust with confectioner's sugar before
serving,
