Steps

In a bowl, whisk milk, vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon into the beaten eggs until
well blended. Set aside. In a separate bowl, cream together raspberry puree
and cream cheese until smooth. Make 'sandwiches' by cutting each slice of
bread in half and spreading raspberry-cheese mixture in the center, then top
with the other half.

Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or griddle. Dip bread into egg
mixture, coating thoroughly. Cook until well-browned on both sides, about 5
minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and nutmeg. Serve immediately.
