Steps

Beat the eggs and sugar in a bowl until smooth. Pour in the cream, milk,
vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg; whisk until smooth. Pour the crushed
cereal into a shallow dish; set aside. Dip the egg bread into the egg mixture
two pieces at a time until the egg has been soaked into the center of the
slices, about 30 seconds per side. Press the soaked bread into the crushed
cereal until coated on both sides. Set the finished slices aside on a piece of
waxed paper.

Melt the butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the French
toast in the hot pan until golden on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.
