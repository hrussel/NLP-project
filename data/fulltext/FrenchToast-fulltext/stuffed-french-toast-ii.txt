Steps

Spread 4 slices oatnut bread on one side with cream cheese. Spread remaining 4
slices on one side with raspberry jam. Press cream cheese slices together with
jam slices, forming sandwiches.

In a medium, shallow bowl, beat together the eggs, milk and almond extract.

Melt butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium high heat. Dip sandwiches in
the egg mixture to coat. Place in the skillet, and cook on both sides until
golden brown.
