Steps

Place the corn, vegetable broth, potatoes, onion, garlic, red chile peppers,
chili powder, salt, parsley, and black pepper in a slow cooker; cover. Cook on
Low for 7 hours.

Pour the vegetable mixture into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than
halfway full. Hold the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and
carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses before leaving it on to
puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately,
you can use a stick blender and puree the mixture in the cooking pot. Once
everything has been pureed, return it to the slow cooker. Stir the soy milk
and margarine to the mixture; cook on Low for 1 hour more. Add the lime juice
to serve.
