tortellini-chowder

Steps

In a large pot over medium heat, cook onion, bell pepper, chile pepper, garlic
and jalapeno in margarine until tender but not brown, 5 minutes.

Stir in broth, potatoes, cumin, salt, pepper and red pepper. Bring to a boil,
then reduce heat and simmer about 20 minutes, until potatoes are just tender.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and
cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside.

In a small bowl, stir together flour and vegetable oil. Pour into soup,
increase heat to medium, and cook until thickened and bubbly. Stir in corn,
half-and-half and tortellini and heat through. Serve.
