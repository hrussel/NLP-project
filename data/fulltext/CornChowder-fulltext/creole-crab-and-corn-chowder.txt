Steps

Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat; stir in onion, jalepeno peppers,
celery, and a pinch of salt. Cook until onions are soft and translucent, 7 to
10 minutes.

Stir seafood seasoning and cayenne pepper into onion mixture; cook for 30
seconds.

Sprinkle flour over onion mixture; cook and stir until mixture is slightly
thickened, about 2 minutes.

Pour 2 1/2 cups water, 1/2 pound corn kernels, and 2 ounces crabmeat into the
onion mixture; increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer.

Place 1 cup water, 1/2 pound corn kernels, and garlic into a blender. Cover
and puree until smooth.

Pour corn puree into the Dutch oven and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat
to low; simmer until chowder is thicker and the color deepens, about 45
minutes.

Stir 6 ounces of crabmeat, paprika, and heavy cream into chowder. Season with
salt and pepper to taste; garnish with green onions and a pinch of cayenne
pepper.
