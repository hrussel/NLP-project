Steps

Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the sweet potatoes
into a 9x13 inch baking dish, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of corn oil, and
season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat the sweet potatoes in oil.

Roast in the preheated oven until the sweet potatoes are golden and tender, 15
to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally as they cook so the sweet potatoes cook
evenly.

Meanwhile, measure out 1 cup of corn kernels and set aside. Place the
remaining corn into a blender, and puree with the water until smooth; set
aside.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of corn oil in a large saucepan over medium
heat. Stir in the celery, onion, and shallot. Cook and stir until the onion
has softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and dried thyme
leaves; cook 1 minute more. Pour in the vegetable broth, corn puree, bay leaf,
salt, and cubed potato. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the
heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potato is tender, 25 to 35
minutes.

Once the potato is tender, remove and discard the bay leaf. Stir in the whole
corn kernels, sweet potato, and chopped parsley. Return to a simmer and season
to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
