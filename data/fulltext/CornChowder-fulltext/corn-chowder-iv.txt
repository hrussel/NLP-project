Steps

Place potatoes in a large pot with water to just cover; bring to a boil, then
reduce heat and simmer until just tender, 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook bacon over medium heat in a large skillet with onion until
just crisp. Drain and set aside.

When potatoes are just tender, stir bacon mixture, creamed corn, evaporated
milk, milk, margarine, cheese, salt and pepper into the pot. Heat, stirring,
10 minutes, until cheese and margarine are melted and mixture is thoroughly
heated.
