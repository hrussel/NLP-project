Steps

Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and
celery in the hot Dutch oven until sausage is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
minutes; drain and discard grease.

Mix potatoes, chicken broth, salt, and pepper into sausage mixture; bring to a
boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are soft, about 10 minutes. Add
whole kernel corn, cream-style corn, evaporated milk, paprika, and cayenne
pepper; simmer until heated through, 5 to 10 more minutes.
