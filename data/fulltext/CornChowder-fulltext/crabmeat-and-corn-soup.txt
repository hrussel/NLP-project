crabmeat-and-corn-soup

Steps

In a heavy-bottomed pot, melt butter, add flour, and stir gently until
blended; do not burn or let it darken. Add milk gradually, stirring all the
while, then add half and half, stirring gently while blending. Add corn and
green onions, and cook for a few minutes until tender.

Add crabmeat, pepper, salt, and soy sauce and simmer until very hot and small
bubbles form around the edge; do not let boil. Adjust seasonings to taste.
Garnish with sprinkles of chopped fresh parsley when serving and serve hot.

Variations: You may use 4 cobs of fresh corn instead of frozen or canned. Cut
the kernels off the cob, scrape cob for juices, and then add to soup. Cook
until corn is tender. Canned crabmeat or imitation crab may be used instead of
fresh crabmeat. Use one 7 1/2-ounce can crabmeat (drained) and 8 ounces
imitation crab (cut into small pieces). Combine the two and cook as noted
above.
