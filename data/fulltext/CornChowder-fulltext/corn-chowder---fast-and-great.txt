Steps

In a large pot over medium heat, cook and stir the bacon until crisp, about 10
minutes. Drain off grease, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pot. Break the
bacon into pieces in the pot.

Place the onion in the pot, and cook until transparent, about 5 minutes. Mix
in the potatoes, and cook until they begin to turn translucent, about 10
minutes more. Stir in the chicken broth, and season with oregano, salt and
pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover, and simmer over low heat
until the potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Pour in the cream-style corn
and whole kernel corn, and cook for 10 more minutes.

Stir in the cream, Monterey Jack cheese, and Cheddar cheese over low heat
until the soup is hot and the cheeses have melted. Do not boil. Remove from
the heat, and serve.
