Steps

Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion,
jalapeno peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is tender, 5 to 7
minutes; season with cumin and cayenne pepper. Add corn, chicken broth, and
diced chicken.

Bring the soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan,
and cook at a simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.
Remove saucepan from heat and let soup cool.

Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down;
pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
Return pureed soup to the saucepan.

Place saucepan over low heat; warm soup, stirring occasionally, until hot,
about 5 minutes. Garnish servings with lime wedges, cilantro, and sour cream.
