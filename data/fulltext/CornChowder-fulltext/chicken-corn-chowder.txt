Steps

Place chicken carcass (and any leftover skin and meat and other bones) in a
large pot and cover with cold water. Add bay leaf, and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat, and simmer 60 to 90 minutes. Remove from heat, cool slightly, and
strain. Remove chicken meat from carcass, and chop into bite-size pieces.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Cook onion and shallots in
butter until translucent. Pour in strained broth and chicken meat and stir in
bouillon, parsley, salt, pepper, potatoes and corn. Simmer 15 minutes, until
potatoes are cooked and corn is tender. Remove from heat and stir in cream.
