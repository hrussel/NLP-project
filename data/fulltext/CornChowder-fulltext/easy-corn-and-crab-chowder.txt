Steps

Wrap potato cubes in plastic wrap, and microwave for 30 seconds. Set aside.

In a saute pan, cook bacon over medium heat until heated through, and add
chopped onions. Cook and stir until onions are clear. Stir in crab meat and
parsley flakes. Set aside.

Meanwhile, melt butter in a large stock pot over low heat. Whisk in flour
until mixture becomes creamy and takes on a eggshell color. Continue to cook
for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in wine. Dissolve chicken
bouillon in milk; when the flour mixture is crumbly, slowly whisk in the milk.
Mix well in order to eliminate all lumps.

When the mixture is creamy and hot, stir in bacon mixture, cubed potatoes, and
creamed corn. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 10 minutes.

For a creamy curry variation add 2 tablespoons curry powder after adding the
wine to the flour mixture, and substitute cooked, cubed chicken for the bacon.
