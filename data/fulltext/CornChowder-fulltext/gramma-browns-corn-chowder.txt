gramma-browns-corn-chowder

Steps

Fry bacon in pan until almost done. Add onions and celery, and saute until
lightly browned.

Transfer to a cooking pot. Add cream-style corn, kernel corn, butter, and
broth. Add carrots and potatoes. Cook for about 15 minutes.

Mix together flour and a little water to form a paste.

Add milk and flour paste. You might want to add more flour paste, depending on
how thick you like your chowder. Simmer for 30 minutes or until you are ready
to eat. Add salt and pepper to taste.
