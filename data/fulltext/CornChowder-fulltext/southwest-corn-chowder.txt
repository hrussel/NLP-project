Steps

Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the tomatillos, and
boil for 10 minutes; drain.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the
onions, and cook until they have softened and turned translucent, about 5
minutes. Stir in the hominy, marjoram, and thyme, cook and stir 5 minutes
more. Pour in the milk, parsley, and half of the corn kernels, and bring to a
simmer over medium-high heat.

Puree the tomatillos with the remaining half of the corn until smooth in a
blender, then stir into the soup along with the roasted peppers. Simmer the
soup for 10 minutes, then remove the parsley sprigs, and sprinkle with
cilantro before serving.
