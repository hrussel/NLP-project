Steps

Cook bacon in a soup pot over medium heat until crisp and brown, about 10
minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in the pot. Cook
and stir onion and red bell pepper until softened, about 5 minutes; season
with salt and pepper. Stir in garlic and seafood seasoning and cook and stir 2
more minutes.

Pour in chicken broth and stir in potatoes and corn; add water if needed to
cover vegetables. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low; simmer until
potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in milk and butter until butter
has melted; mix in reserved bacon. Bring the soup just to the boiling point
and stir in cod and parsley; cook, stirring occasionally, until fish flakes
easily, 5 to 8 minutes.
