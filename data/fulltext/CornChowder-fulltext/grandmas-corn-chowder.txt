Steps

Place the bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat, and cook until crisp.
Drain and crumble, reserving about 2 tablespoons drippings in the pot.

Mix potatoes and onion into the pot with the crumbled bacon and reserved
drippings. Cook and stir 5 minutes. Pour in the water, and stir in corn.
Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover
pot. Simmer 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until potatoes are tender.

Warm the half-and-half in a small saucepan until it bubbles. Remove from heat
before it boils, and mix into the chowder just before serving.
