Steps

In a large pot over medium heat, combine water, bouillon, potatoes and garlic.
Bring to a boil, then stir in onion, celery and carrots. Reduce heat and
simmer 15 minutes.

Stir in corn, peas and green beans and continue to cook on low heat.

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Whisk in flour
all at once to form a roux and let cook 10 seconds. Whisk in milk, a little at
a time, and cook, stirring, until mixture is thick and bubbly. Stir in cheese
until melted. Pour this mixture into the large soup pot, stir well and heat
through.
