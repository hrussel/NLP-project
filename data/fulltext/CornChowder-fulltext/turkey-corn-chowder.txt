Steps

Place the potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil,
reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.
Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Cut the meat from the turkey
legs, discarding the bones and tendons. Chop the turkey meat and set aside.

Heat the butter in a soup pot over medium heat; cook the onion in the butter
until translucent, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the butter and
onion; stir constantly until the butter and flour form a paste. Allow the
paste to fry for about 1 minute. Whisk in the chicken broth, potatoes, turkey
meat, and corn; stir until the mixture comes to a low boil and thickens, about
5 minutes. With a potato masher, slightly mash the potatoes and vegetables
until the potatoes look rounded off. Pour in the cream, bring soup back to a
simmer, and allow to cook without boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
