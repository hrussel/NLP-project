Steps

In a large saucepan over medium high heat, melt the butter and stir in the
onion, potato, bay leaf, cumin, and sage. Saute about 5 minutes, until the
onion is tender. Mix in the flour, coating the onion and potato. Pour in the
chicken stock and milk. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly until smooth.
Reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring frequently, until the potato is
tender.

Mix the corn, parsley, chives, and wine into the saucepan, and cook about 5
minutes, until heated through. Remove the bay leaf, and stir in the Cheddar
cheese until melted and blended. Season with salt and pepper.
