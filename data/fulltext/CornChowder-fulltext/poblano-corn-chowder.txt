Steps

In a blender or food processor, puree the onion and celery; drain.

Melt 2 tablespoons margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the
onion and celery puree and the poblano chile pepper. Stirring constantly, cook
about 5 minutes, until tender. Mix in heavy cream, half-and-half cream, sugar,
and lobster base. Season with chile de arbol and black pepper. Stirring often,
bring to a gentle boil.

Melt 1/2 cup margarine in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Mix in the
flour, and stir constantly until thickened. Remove from heat, and gradually
mix into the large saucepan. Cook and stir until the mixture is well blended
and thickened.

Mix cream-style corn and whole kernel corn into the large saucepan mixture.
Stir in the shrimp, and cook 2 minutes, or until opaque. Season with salt and
sugar.
