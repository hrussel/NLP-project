Steps

Melt butter in a 4-quart pot. Add leeks (strips of the white and pale green
parts only) and celery and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, 5 to 7
minutes.

Add potatoes and broth; cover and simmer until potatoes are almost tender,
about 10 minutes. Stir in corn, milk, cream, salt, and pepper, and nutmeg and
cook until potatoes are very tender, about 10 minutes more.

Meanwhile, brown ground sausage in a large skillet. Remove sausage and grease
from pot and reserve till later. Stir sausage into soup just before serving.
