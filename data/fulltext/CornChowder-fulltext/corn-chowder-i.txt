Steps

Boil potatoes in salted water until soft. Drain. Mash half of the potatoes and
set aside.

Fry the bacon until very crisp. Crumple the bacon and set aside.

Fry the onion inn the bacon grease until translucent and soft.

Dump the cooked onions into a large stockpot. Add the flour and heat until the
mixture is bubbly and the flour is well dissolved. Add the milk and bring to a
boil over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. You need to watch your pot
pretty carefully while bringing to a boil and heating. The bottom tends to
easily scorch. Once boiling add the salt, pepper, bacon, corn and all the
potatoes. (If desired reserve some of the bacon for the garnish.)

Heat soup until hot. Serve garnished with a dash of paprika, a sprinkling of
cheddar cheese and some crumbled bacon.
