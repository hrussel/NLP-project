jalapeno-bacon-cheddar-deviled-eggs

Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Place bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper
towels; crumble when cool enough to handle.

Remove seeds and stems from jalapenos; mince 1 pepper and slice remaining
peppers into very thin strips; set aside.

Cut eggs in half lengthwise; place yolks in a bowl. Mash egg yolks with a
fork; stir in minced jalapeno, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, red onion, and
mustard.

Place egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into egg
white halves; sprinkle with crumbled bacon and paprika.
