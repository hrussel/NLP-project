Steps

Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover
the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil; remove
from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Drain
the hot water and cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink; peel the
cooled eggs.

Cut the chilled eggs in half lengthwise. Place the yolks into a mixing bowl
and set the whites aside. Mash the yolks with a fork until smooth; stir in the
mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish sauce, hot sauce, salt, and
pepper. Spoon the yolk mixture into a heavy plastic bag; snip a corner off the
bag to create a 1/2-inch opening. Pipe the yolks into the egg white halves.
Sprinkle with parsley and paprika to garnish.
