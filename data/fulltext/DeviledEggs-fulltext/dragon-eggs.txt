Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from
heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain hot water and fill
saucepan with cold water; allow eggs to sit until cooled, 15 to 20 minutes.
Drain water. Gently tap or roll eggs on the counter so the shell is cracked
but still intact.

Return eggs to saucepan and pour in enough water to cover eggs; add soy sauce,
molasses, salt, and tea bags. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until
eggs have absorbed color, about 30 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and
leave eggs in water to cool to room temperature.

Peel eggs and trim bottom of each egg so it will stand upright. Cut each egg
lengthwise and scoop yolks into a bowl. Mix mayonnaise, red bell pepper, salt,
and pepper into egg yolks until evenly combined.

Spoon yolk mixture back into egg whites; smooth filling to be level with egg
white. Put each egg back together.

Pour salsa onto a plate and assemble eggs upright into the salsa.
