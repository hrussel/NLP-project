Steps

Place eggs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a
boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water
for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.

Slice eggs in half lengthwise and remove yolks. Place yolks in a medium bowl.
Mash together with ranch-style salad dressing. Mix in the cream cheese, then
the onion and dill pickle.

Fill the hollowed egg whites generously with the egg yolk mixture. Chill in
the refrigerator until serving.
