Steps

Place eggs in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and
immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to
12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.

Slice the eggs in half lengthwise and place the yolks into a bowl and mash
with a fork. Set aside some of the Parmesan cheese and chives to use as a
garnish. Mix the remaining into the yolks along with the prosciutto, green
olives, red bell pepper, Dijon mustard, sour cream, mayonnaise, hot sauce,
garlic powder and pepper. Spoon the yolk mixture back into the egg white
halves. Garnish with reserved Parmesan cheese and chives.
