Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from
heat, and let eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Remove from hot
water and chill at least 30 minutes in a bowl of cold water or in the
refrigerator, until eggs are cold.

Prepare egg dye according to package directions in a large metal or glass
bowl.

Gently crack eggs but do not remove shells so that the egg dye can reach the
egg whites.

Place the cracked hard-cooked eggs into the dye, working in batches if
necessary, until dye seeps through the cracks and colors the eggs slightly,
about 5 minutes per batch.

Rinse eggs and peel to expose the green marbled color; slice eggs in half
lengthwise.

Scoop egg yolks into a bowl and mash with a fork and mix in the mayonnaise and
celery; stir green food coloring into the yolk mixture.

Spoon the yolk mixture into the egg halves; top each egg half with a parsley
leaf.
