Steps

Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover
the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high
heat. Remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15
minutes. Drain. Cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel once cold. Halve
the eggs lengthwise and scoop the yolks into a bowl. Mash the yolks with a
fork.

Stir the mayonnaise, spicy brown mustard, hot mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper
into the yolks until well combined. Spoon into a quart-size, resealable
plastic bag. Snip a corner off the plastic bag.

Squeeze the yolk mixture into the egg halves, sprinkle each stuffed egg with
paprika, and top with an olive half.
