huevos-endiablados

Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from
heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot
water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Allow to cool completely,
about 20 minutes.

Slice each egg in half lengthwise, remove yolks and place them in a bowl. Set
the whites aside on a serving platter. Mash yolks together with tuna, red
onion, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, garlic, smoked paprika, and salt until
smooth and combined. Fill each egg white half with about a tablespoon of
filling. Garnish with smoked paprika.
