sriracha-deviled-eggs

Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Cut eggs in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a small bowl. Mash yolks with
a fork; stir mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, dry mustard, and cayenne pepper into
yolks until smooth; season with salt. Spoon yolk mixture into a resealable
plastic bag; snip off one corner of the bag.

Place egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Pipe the yolk mixture into
egg white halves; sprinkle with smoked paprika. Refrigerate deviled eggs,
covered, until ready to serve.
