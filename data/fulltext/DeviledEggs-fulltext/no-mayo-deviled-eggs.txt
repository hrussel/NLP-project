Steps

Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover
the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high
heat. Remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15
minutes. Drain. Cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel once cold. Halve
the eggs lengthwise and scoop the yolks into a bowl.

Add the avocado and sour cream to the egg yolks and mash into a smooth, creamy
mixture. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, dill, salt, and white pepper until
the mixture is very well blended; spoon into the egg white halves and garnish
with chopped green onion.
