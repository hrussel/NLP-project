Steps

Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a
boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water
for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.

Slice eggs lengthwise. Remove yolks and place in a sieve. Using a spoon or
fork, force egg yolks through a sieve into a small bowl.

Into the bowl with the egg yolks, mix mayonnaise, barbeque seasoning, prepared
Dijon-style mustard, lemon juice and ground black pepper. Place the mixture in
a plastic ziplock bag. Cut one corner from the bag, and pipe the egg yolk
mixture into the egg whites. Top with sliced green olives. Chill in the
refrigerator until serving.
