Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and
immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to
12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and run under cold water to cool. Peel
eggs, and cut into halves lengthwise.

Carefully remove the yolks from the eggs, and place them into a medium bowl,
scooping out a little bit of the white along with the yolk to make a more
generous cup for filling. Mash the egg yolks with deviled ham, relish and
enough mayonnaise to make a smooth mixture. Season with salt and pepper to
taste.

Spoon the mixture into the egg whites, or pipe with a piping bag for a more
elegant look. Garnish filling with a sprinkle of paprika, and top some of them
with a slice of green olive stuffed with pimento. Chill until serving.
