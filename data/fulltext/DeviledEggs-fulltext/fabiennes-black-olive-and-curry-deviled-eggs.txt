Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a
fork; stir in mayonnaise, olives, mustard, lemon juice, curry powder, onion
powder, vinegar, and garlic.

Place egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into egg
white halves.
