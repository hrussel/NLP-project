12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.

Cut the eggs in half lengthwise and carefully remove the yolks to a bowl. Mash
the yolks with the mayonnaise and mustard and season with pepper and ranch
dressing mix, blending until smooth. Spoon the mixture into the egg white
halves and garnish with a sprinkle of paprika.
