Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Place sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until
lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Remove to cool on a plate lined with a paper
towel.

Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks into a food processor with
mayonnaise, soy sauce, wasabi paste, and rice vinegar. Process until smooth;
place green onion and panko bread crumbs into yolk mixture and pulse just
enough to mix evenly.

Arrange egg white halves on a serving platter; spoon yolk mixture into whites.
Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
