Steps

Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover
the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high
heat. Remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15
minutes. Drain. Cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel once cold. Halve
the eggs lengthwise and scoop the yolks into a bowl. Mash the yolks with a
fork.

Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate; chop once cool.
Add to the mashed egg yolks. Stir the basil, mayonnaise, red pepper flakes,
salt, and pepper into the mixture until evenly mixed. Fill the egg white
halves with the mixture; sprinkle each stuffed egg with a bit of paprika.
