Steps

Place water, chiles, onion, vinegar, ketchup, garlic, and salt in a saucepan;
bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced and very
thick, about 1 hour.

Pour chile mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid
down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend until smooth. Stir cream
into chipotle sauce; refrigerate until ready to use.

Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Place bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper
towels. Crumble half the bacon; reserve remaining bacon for garnish.

Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks into a bowl. Mash egg yolks
with a fork; stir in mayonnaise, crumbled bacon, and Cheddar cheese. Stir 1
tablespoon chipotle sauce into yolk mixture, or more to taste.

Place egg whites cut-side up on a serving plate. Spoon yolk mixture into egg
white halves. Sprinkle remaining bacon over filling; drizzle with chipotle
sauce.
