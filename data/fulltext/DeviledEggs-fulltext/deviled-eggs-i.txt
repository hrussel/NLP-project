Place eggs in a pot of salted water. Bring the water to a boil, and let eggs
cook in boiling water until they are hard boiled, approximately 10 to 15
minutes. Drain eggs, and let cool.

Cut eggs in half, lengthwise. Remove the egg yolks and mash them together in a
small mixing bowl. Mix in the paprika, mayonnaise, and dry mustard. Spoon
mixture into the egg whites; cool and serve.
