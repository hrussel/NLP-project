parmesan-oregano-deviled-eggs

Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a
fork; stir in mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Parmesan cheese, oregano, and pepper
sauce; season with salt and pepper.

Arrange egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into a
resealable plastic bag; snip off one corner of the bag, and pipe filling into
egg white halves. Sprinkle deviled eggs with Cheddar cheese and paprika.
