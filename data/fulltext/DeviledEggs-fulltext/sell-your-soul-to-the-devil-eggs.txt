Steps

Place the eggs in a saucepan in a single layer with enough water to cover by 1
inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once
the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot
water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water, then cool the eggs under cold
running water. Peel once cold.

Dry the eggs thoroughly with paper towels, and slice them in half lengthwise.
Remove the yolks, and place in a bowl. Mash the yolks with a fork, and stir in
the sugar, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and white pepper. Add the
mustard, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and vinegar, one at a time, stirring to
incorporate each ingredient before adding the next.

Mound a heaping teaspoonful of the yolk mixture into the cavity of each egg
half, and sprinkle with paprika.
