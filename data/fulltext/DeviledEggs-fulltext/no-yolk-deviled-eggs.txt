no-yolk-deviled-eggs

Steps

Place the eggs in a pan of cold water and bring to a boil. Once they boil,
remove from the heat, cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Drain, cool and
peel.

Place the potato in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil,
and cook until tender. Drain.

Cut the eggs in half lengthwise, and remove the yolks; reserve for other uses
or discard. Place the potatoes in a medium bowl. Mash with a whisk until
smooth, then mix in the relish, sugar, mayonnaise and mustard. Spoon into the
egg whites, and dust with paprika. Refrigerate or serve.
