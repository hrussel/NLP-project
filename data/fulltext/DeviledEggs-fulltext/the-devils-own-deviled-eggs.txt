Steps

Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer, and fill with water to cover
the eggs by at least 1 inch. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Cover,
and remove from the heat; let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes.
Pour out the hot water, then cool the eggs under cold running water in the
sink. Peel.

Cut the cooled eggs in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks, and place them into
a mixing bowl along with the jalapeno, habanero, mayonnaise, and mustard; mash
together until smooth. Transfer the yolk mixture to a pastry bag, and
decoratively squeeze into the white halves. Sprinkle with paprika to garnish.
