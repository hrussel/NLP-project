Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on
paper towels.

Cut each egg in half lengthwise. Scoop egg yolks out; place 3 to 6 egg yolks
in a bowl, reserving remaining egg yolks for another use.

Mash the 3 to 6 egg yolks with a fork; stir in avocado, lemon juice, cayenne
pepper, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper.

Arrange egg whites cut-side-up on a serving platter. Spoon avocado mixture
into egg whites.

Chop bacon into 1/2-inch pieces; place bacon and paprika in a small bowl and
toss to coat bacon. Top deviled eggs with bacon pieces.
