Steps

Place eggs in a pot of salted water. Bring the water to a boil, and let eggs
cook in boiling water until they are hard boiled, approximately 10 to 15
minutes. Drain eggs, and let cool. Once cool, remove the shell, cut the eggs
in half lengthwise and scoop out the yolks.

Place the yolks in a medium-size mixing bowl and mash them. Blend in vinegar,
mayonnaise, mustard, salt and pepper. You may need to add more mayonnaise to
hold the mixture together, but it should be slightly dry.

Carefully put the egg yolk mixture back into the egg whites but do not pack
it. There will be enough mixture so the whites are overfilled. Sprinkle with
paprika. Place on bed of lettuce and/or garnish with parsley. Cool before
serving.
