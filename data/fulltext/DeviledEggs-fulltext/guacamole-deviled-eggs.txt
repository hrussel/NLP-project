guacamole-deviled-eggs

Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and
immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to
12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, and peel. Slice eggs in half, and
remove yolks to a mixing bowl.

In the bowl with the yolks, combine the avocado, cilantro, green onion, and
jalapeno. Stir in the lime juice, and season with salt, hot sauce,
Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Mix well, and fill empty egg white halves.
Chill until serving. Sprinkle with paprika just before serving.
