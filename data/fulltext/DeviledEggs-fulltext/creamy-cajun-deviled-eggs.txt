creamy-cajun-deviled-eggs

Steps

Place eggs into a saucepan, cover with cold water, and place over high heat.
When water is boiling, cover saucepan with a lid, reduce heat to low, and
simmer for 18 minutes. Remove from heat and cool eggs under cold running water
until eggs can be handled. Peel eggs.

Cut eggs in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a mixing bowl. Beat yolks,
cream cheese, creamy salad dressing, pickle relish, hot sauce, salt, and black
pepper until mixture is creamy and smooth. Spoon yolk mixture into egg white
halves. Sprinkle each deviled egg half lightly with Cajun seasoning. Chill
before serving.
