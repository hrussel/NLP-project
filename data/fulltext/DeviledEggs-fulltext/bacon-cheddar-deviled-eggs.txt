Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and
immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to
12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and cool. To cool more quickly, rinse eggs
under cold running water.

Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat
until evenly brown. Alternatively, wrap bacon in paper towels and cook in the
microwave for about 1 minute per slice. Crumble and set aside.

Peel the hard-cooked eggs, and cut in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a small
bowl. Mash egg yolks with mayonnaise, crumbled bacon and cheese. Stir in
mustard. Fill egg white halves with the yolk mixture and refrigerate until
serving.
