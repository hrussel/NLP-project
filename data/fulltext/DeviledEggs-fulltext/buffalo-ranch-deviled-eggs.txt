Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a
fork; stir in ranch dressing and hot Buffalo sauce until smooth. Spoon yolk
mixture into a resealable plastic bag; snip off one corner of the bag.

Place egg white halves cut-side-up on a serving platter; pipe yolk mixture
into whites. Sprinkle with cayenne pepper. Cut celery into tiny stalks and
place one on top of each egg.
