Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water,
cool under cold running water, and peel.

Cut each egg in half lengthwise. Place yolks in a bowl; mash yolks with a
fork. Stir crab meat, oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, and dry mustard
into yolks; beat with an electric mixer on low speed to combine. Add water
gradually to egg yolk mixture and increase mixer speed slowly, beating until
smooth.

Place egg whites on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into egg whites;
sprinkle with seafood seasoning.
