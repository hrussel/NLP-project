Steps

Place the kidney beans, chili beans, black beans, and black-eyed peas in a
large, heavy pot., and simmer over medium heat.

Place the ground beef and sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook
until crumbly and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, and stir into the
bean mixture.

Place the red and green bell peppers, yellow and red onions, and garlic on top
of the bean and meat mixture. Cover and steam for at least 10 minutes. Stir in
the jalapeno, chipotle, serrano, habanero, banana, cherry and Anaheim peppers,
red and green Thai chilies, chili powder, cumin, red pepper flakes, and taco
seasoning. Season to taste with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cover,
and simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours.
