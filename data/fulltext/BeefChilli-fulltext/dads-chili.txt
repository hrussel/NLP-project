Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef and
ground pork. Cook and stir until the meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no
longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Set meat aside. Melt the
butter in the pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, bell pepper, and
onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent,
about 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked meat, pinto beans, tomatoes, parsley,
chili powder, pepper, monosodium glutamate, salt, and cumin. Cover and bring
to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour.
