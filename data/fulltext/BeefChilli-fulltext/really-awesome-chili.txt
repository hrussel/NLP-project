Steps

In a large soup pot over medium heat, cook and stir the ground chuck and
ground pork until the meat is browned, about 15 minutes, breaking the meat
into crumbles as it cooks. Drain off the excess grease, reserving about 1/2
cup of drippings, and cook and stir the onion and garlic until they begin to
brown, about 10 minutes.

Stir in the stout beer, tomato paste, water, beef stock, chili powder, cumin,
Mexican oregano, smoked paprika, coriander seed, cocoa powder, chipotle-
flavored hot sauce, cornmeal, and flour until thoroughly combined, and bring
to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 8 hours.
