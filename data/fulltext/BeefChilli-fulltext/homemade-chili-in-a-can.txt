Steps

Place ground beef into a soup pot over medium heat, and cook and stir until
the meat is browned, breaking it up into crumbles as it cooks, about 10
minutes. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent,
about 5 more minutes. Drain excess grease if necessary, and sprinkle the meat
with taco seasoning mix; cook the meat with the seasoning for 1 or 2 more
minutes.

Pour in the chili-flavored tomatoes, chili beans, tomato sauce, and diced
green chilies, and stir to combine; simmer for 30 minutes to blend flavors.
