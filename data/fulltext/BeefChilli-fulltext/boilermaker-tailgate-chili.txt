Steps

Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Crumble the ground chuck and
sausage into the hot pan, and cook until evenly browned. Drain off excess
grease.

Pour in the chili beans, spicy chili beans, diced tomatoes and tomato paste.
Add the onion, celery, green and red bell peppers, chile peppers, bacon bits,
bouillon, and beer. Season with chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic,
oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and
sugar. Stir to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat for at least 2
hours, stirring occasionally.

After 2 hours, taste, and adjust salt, pepper, and chili powder if necessary.
The longer the chili simmers, the better it will taste. Remove from heat and
serve, or refrigerate, and serve the next day.

To serve, ladle into bowls, and top with corn chips and shredded Cheddar
cheese.
