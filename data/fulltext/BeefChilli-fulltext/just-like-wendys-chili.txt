Steps

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Press ground beef into
the hot oil to form one large patty; let the bottom brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
Stir and break the ground beef into crumbles and cook until no longer pink,
about 5 more minutes.

Stir celery, onion, and green bell pepper into ground beef and cook until
onion is translucent, about 5 minutes; pour in stewed tomatoes, diced tomatoes
with green chiles, tomato sauce, and water. Break apart large chunks of stewed
tomatoes. Stir in chili seasoning.

Mix kidney beans and pinto beans into chili, season with salt and black
pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Mix
vinegar into chili.
