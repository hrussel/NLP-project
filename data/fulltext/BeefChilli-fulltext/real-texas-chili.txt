Steps

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the beef cubes in
the oil for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir in the garlic.

In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, cumin and flour. Sprinkle over the
meat and stir until evenly coated. Crumble the oregano over the meat and pour
in 1 1/2 cans of the broth.

Add the salt and ground black pepper, stir together well, bring to a boil,
reduce heat to low and let simmer, partially covered for about 90 minutes.
Pour in remaining broth and simmer 30 minutes more, until meat begins to fall
apart. Cool, cover and refrigerate to allow the flavors to blend.
