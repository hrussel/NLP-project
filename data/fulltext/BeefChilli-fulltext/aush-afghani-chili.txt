aush-afghani-chili

Steps

Brown ground beef in a skillet over medium heat; remove with slotted spoon to
a large pot; reserving drippings in the skillet. Cook and stir the onion in
the reserved drippings until golden brown; remove with slotted spoon and add
to beef in the pot. Stir the tomatoes with juice, garlic, red pepper, cumin,
chili powder, mint, garam masala, garbanzo beans, and spinach into the beef
mixture and place the pot over low heat; simmer 3 to 6 hours.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fettuccini, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink. Stir into the chili along with the sour cream and
serve hot.
