Steps

Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat until crumbly and
browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain.

Stir drained ground beef, black beans, kidney beans, tomatoes, green bell
peppers, yellow onion, garlic, and chili seasoning together in a large pot
over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer,
stirring occasionally, until vegetables are slightly tender and chili is
heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with hot sauce, salt, and ground
black pepper to taste.
