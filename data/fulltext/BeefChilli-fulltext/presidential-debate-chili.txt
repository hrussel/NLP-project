Crumble beef into a large pot over medium-high heat; add onion and garlic.
Cook and stir beef until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and
discard excess grease. Return pot to medium-high heat.

Stir diced tomatoes, beef broth, diced green chilies, chili powder, brown
sugar, oregano, cumin, and salt through the beef mixture. Add beans and bring
to a boil.

Reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the pot, and simmer for 1 hour.
