Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the ground beef, onion and
bacon for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the meat is browned and the onion is
translucent; drain excess fat.

In a 3 quart casserole dish, combine the vinegar, mustard, ketchup, brown
sugar, green bell pepper, kidney beans, chili beans, pork and beans and the
meat mixture. Stir together until well blended.

Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, remove from oven
and top with the cheese and crushed tortilla chips. Return to oven and bake
for 5 to 6 more minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
