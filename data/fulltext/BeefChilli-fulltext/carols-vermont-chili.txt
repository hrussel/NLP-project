Steps

Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion,
red bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until the onion is
tender, about 7 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, maple syrup,
and kidney beans. Season with black pepper and chili powder. Bring to a boil,
then reduce heat to a simmer.

Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground
beef. Sprinkle beef with salt. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly
browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease; stir into
the chili along with 1 beer. Cook and stir for 1 hour, stirring frequently.
Season to taste with salt, and thin to desired consistency with 1 beer before
serving.
