Steps

Place black beans, pinto beans, and kidney beans in a large container and
cover with several inches of cool water; let stand for at least 12 hours.
Bring beans and water to a boil in a large pot; cook until beans are tender
and heated through, 30 minutes. Remove pot from heat to cool and drain beans.

Cook and stir sausage, beef, onion, bell pepper, and garlic in a large skillet
over medium-high heat until meat is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and
discard fat.

Stir beans, sausage mixture, corn, salsa, chili sauce, vinegar, and water
together in a slow cooker.

Cook on High for at least 4 hours, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and
ground black pepper.
