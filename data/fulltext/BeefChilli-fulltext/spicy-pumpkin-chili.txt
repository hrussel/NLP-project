Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the beef in the
skillet until crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the red
pepper flakes, garlic, and onion; continue cooking until the beef has browned
and the onion has softened and turned translucent. Add the green and red bell
pepper and cook 5 minutes more.

While the beef is cooking, combine the kidney beans, black beans, Great
Northern beans, tomato sauce, tomato sauce with garlic and onions, petite
diced tomatoes, fire roasted diced tomatoes, and pumpkin puree in a large slow
cooker. Season with pumpkin pie spice, chili powder, cumin, and salt. Stir in
the ground beef mixture.

Cook on Low until the chili is hot, 1 to 2 hours.
