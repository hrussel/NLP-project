Steps

Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until
evenly brown. Drain, and crumble.

In a large pot over high heat combine the ground beef, tomato juice, tomato
sauce, kidney beans, pinto beans, onions, bell pepper, cayenne pepper, sugar,
oregano, ground black pepper, salt, cumin and chili powder. Bring to a boil,
then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours. (Note: If using a slow
cooker, set on low, add ingredients, and cook for 8 to 10 hours.)
