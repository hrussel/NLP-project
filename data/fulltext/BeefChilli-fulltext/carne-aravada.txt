carne-aravada

Steps

In a saucepan, combine water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and beef cubes. Bring to
boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Combine the chile powder, minced garlic, and oregano in a small bowl. Add
enough of the beef cooking water to make a paste. After 30 minutes, stir the
spice paste into the beef mixture.

Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook flour, stirring
constantly, until golden brown. Take 1 cup of the spiced cooking water and
whisk it into the flour mixture until smooth. Stir in the cumin, chopped
parsley, and salt.

Transfer the thickened sauce mixture into the saucepan with the beef. Simmer
until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
