Steps

Place ground beef in a large saucepan with water and mash the beef with a
potato masher to break apart. Stir in tomato sauce, ketchup, chili powder,
salt, black pepper, sugar, onion powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a
boil and cook over medium heat until the chili has thickened slightly and the
beef is fully cooked, about 20 minutes.
