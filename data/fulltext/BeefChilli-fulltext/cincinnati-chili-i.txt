Steps

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring
frequently, until tender, about 6 minutes.

Add beef, in batches if necessary, and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon,
until browned.

Add chili powder, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, cloves, bay leaf, chocolate, beef
broth, tomato sauce, cider vinegar, and red pepper. Stir to mix well. Bring to
a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring
occasionally.

It is the best if you now refrigerate overnight.

Remove the bay leaf. Reheat gently over medium heat. Serve over hot, drained
spaghetti. Top with shredded cheddar cheese.
