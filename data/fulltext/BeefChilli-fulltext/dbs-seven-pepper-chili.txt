Steps

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Brush beef tip
with barbeque sauce and grill 5 to 8 minutes on a side, or to desired
doneness, brushing frequently with sauce. Set aside.

In a large pot over medium heat, cook onion and bell, habanero, pepperoncini,
serrano, cayenne, pequin and jalapeno peppers until onion is translucent. Stir
in cumin, paprika, oregano and chili powder and cook until fragrant. Stir in
ground beef and cook until brown. Drain.

Stir in tomato sauce, any remaining barbeque sauce and beans. Cut grilled tip
steak into bite sized pieces and stir into chili as well. Continue to cook
until thickened and flavors have blended and mixture is thoroughly heated.
Thin with water if desired.
