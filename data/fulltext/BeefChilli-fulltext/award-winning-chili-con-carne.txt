Steps

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook green pepper, and onion,
until softened. Add the ground beef and cook until browned. Crumble over
bouillon cubes, and stir in wine; continue to cook for a few minutes. Stir in
chopped tomatoes, garlic, and tomato paste. Season with paprika, chili powder,
cayenne pepper, basil, oregano, and parsley. Stir in salt and pepper.

Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium low. Cover, and simmer
for 90 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Stir in kidney beans, and hot pepper sauce. You can add the reserved tomato
juice if more liquid is needed. Continue to simmer for an additional 30
minutes.

In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, corn meal, and water until smooth.
Stir into chili, and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until chili has
thickened up.
