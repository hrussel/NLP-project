Steps

Crumble the ground chuck into a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring
occasionally until evenly browned. Drain grease. Transfer the beef to a large
soup pot. Add onions, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beer and chili beans.
Season with Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, chili powder, jalapenos,
and red pepper flakes, if using.

Cover the pot, and simmer over low heat for 2 hours. Turn off heat, and let
cool, then refrigerate for two days. It gets much better with time. Heat and
serve.
