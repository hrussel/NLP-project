Steps

In a large Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Brown the ground
beef until no longer pink. Drain most of the fat from the ground beef.

Push the ground beef to the sides of the pan and saute the onion and garlic in
the middle until softened.

Pour in beef stock, red wine, and balsamic vinegar. Stir in tomatoes, sun-
dried tomatoes, tomato paste and black beans. Mix thoroughly. Sprinkle in the
cayenne pepper, chili powder, salt, pepper, oregano, sage and sugar, then add
the bay leaf. Mix thoroughly.

Cover and simmer on lowest heat for 45 to 90 minutes.
