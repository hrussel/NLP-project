Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the ground beef in the hot
skillet until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain.

Combine the drained beef in a slow cooker with the bell peppers, onions,
kidney beans, black beans, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes. Cook on High for
30 minutes. Stir the garlic, chili powder, paprika, oregano, rosemary,
coriander, garlic powder, salt, cumin, cilantro, and bay leaves into the beef
mixture. Reduce heat to Low and cook another 6 1/2 hours.
