down-and-dirty-garlic-chili

Steps

Heat a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ground beef, and
cook until evenly browned. Stir occasionally to crumble. Season the beef with
chili powder, onion flakes, cumin, paprika, garlic and red pepper flakes, and
mix well.

Pour in the tomatoes, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Reduce heat to low, and
simmer for at least 30 minutes, or longer for thicker chili. Season to taste
with salt and pepper.
