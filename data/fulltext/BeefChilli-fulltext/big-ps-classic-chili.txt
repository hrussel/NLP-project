Steps

Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large soup pot over medium heat; cook
and stir onion, celery, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 5
minutes. Stir ground beef into onion mixture; cook and stir until ground beef
is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain grease.

Stir tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, garlic
powder, oregano, salt, and pepper into ground beef mixture; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until
flavors blend, about 1 1/2 hours. Add kidney beans; simmer for 10 more
minutes.
