Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in Italian sausage and
ground sirloin. Cook and stir until meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no
longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.

Transfer meat to a large Dutch oven; place over medium-high heat. Stir in
chopped onion; add red, yellow, and green bell peppers, garlic, and jalapeno
peppers. Cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.

Mix in chili powder, brown sugar, cumin, tomato paste, oregano, salt, black
pepper, and bay leaves. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes more.

Stirring constantly, pour in wine, chopped tomatoes and their juice, kidney
beans, tomato sauce, and chopped chipotle chiles in sauce. Bring to a boil.
Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.

Uncover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes.
Discard bay leaves before serving.
