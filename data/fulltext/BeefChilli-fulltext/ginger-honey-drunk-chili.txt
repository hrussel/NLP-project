Steps

Heat bacon drippings in a heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium heat. Cook and
stir carrot in the hot drippings for about 3 minutes.

Stir the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper,
habanero pepper, and onion with the carrot; cook and stir until tender, 3 to 4
minutes.

Stir in garlic and beef; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 10
minutes. Drain excess grease from the pot.

Stir tomato paste and tomato sauce into the beef mixture. Increase heat to
medium-high heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes.

Pour in dark beer, tequila, and chicken broth; bring to a boil.

Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in chili powder, paprika, cumin, coriander,
salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, white pepper, and honey. Simmer for 45
minutes to 2 hours.

Stir grated ginger into the chili about 15 minutes before serving.
