Steps

Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the pot
until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.

Cook and stir onions, jalapeno peppers, habanero peppers, and garlic with the
ground beef until onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add chili
beans, tomatoes, water, chili powder, and cumin; bring to a boil. Reduce heat
and simmer until flavors blend, about 1 hour.
