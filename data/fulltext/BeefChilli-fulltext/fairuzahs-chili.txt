Steps

In a large pot, combine the ground beef, ground turkey, and onion. Cook,
stirring, over medium heat until meat is cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Stir in the kidney beans, baked beans, tomatoes, and mushrooms. Season with
chili powder, garlic, garlic powder, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat
to low, and simmer for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The longer the
better. After the first half-hour has passed, taste, and adjust seasonings to
suit your preference.
