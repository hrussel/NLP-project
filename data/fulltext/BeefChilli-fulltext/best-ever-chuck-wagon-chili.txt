Steps

In a large pot, cook the ground beef over medium heat until evenly browned.
Drain off grease, and set aside.

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute the onions, green pepper and
habanero pepper until onions are translucent. Remove from heat. Transfer the
onion mixture to the pot with the ground beef, and set the heat to medium.

Add the kidney beans and tomato sauce to the beef mixture, and season with
chili powder, salt, garlic salt and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a simmer, and
adjust seasonings to taste if necessary. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer
for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
