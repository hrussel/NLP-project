Steps

Place sweet potatoes, stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, onion, celery, water,
chili powder, cumin, cinnamon, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic
powder, and onion powder in a slow cooker. Cook on high, stirring
occasionally, for 5 hours.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground turkey and
ground beef. Cook and stir until meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no
longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Add cooked
ground turkey, cooked ground beef, black beans, and corn to sweet potato
mixture in the slow cooker; cook until flavors have blended, 1 to 2 more
hours. Serve warm.
