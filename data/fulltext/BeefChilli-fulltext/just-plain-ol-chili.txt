Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add ground beef; cook and stir until
meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain
and discard any excess grease.

Heat olive oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green pepper
in the hot oil until it starts to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low,
stir in garlic, cumin, and chili powder, and season with salt and black pepper
to taste.

Mix cooked ground beef and tomatoes into green bell pepper mixture, breaking
up tomatoes with a spatula. Add 4 cups of water or enough to cover the
ingredients, reduce heat to low, and simmer at least 2 hours to blend flavors.
