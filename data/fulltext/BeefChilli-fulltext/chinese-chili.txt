Steps

Heat vegetable oil over medium heat in a large soup pot, and brown the pork
and beef, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Mix in the green bell peppers,
onions, and celery. Cook until the vegetables have given up their juice; cover
and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in beef
broth, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, black pepper, and chili powder.

Mix the soy sauce and cornstarch in a bowl until smooth, and pour it into the
soup. Stir until the soup thickens, about 1 minute; cover the chili, and
reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer until the meat is very tender and the flavors
have blended, about 2 hours; about 5 minutes before serving, stir in the
mushrooms and bean sprouts.
