Steps

Place the ground beef and half the chili powder into a large saucepan over
high heat, and cook until meat is browned, breaking the meat apart into
crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Mix in the onion, and cook and stir
until onion is softened, about 10 more minutes. Stir in garlic, and cook until
fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining chili powder, cumin, oregano,
tomato paste, and cocoa powder, and cover pan.

Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until meat is tender and flavors have
blended, mixing enough water to make a thick chili, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir
occasionally.
