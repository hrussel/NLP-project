Steps

Brown the beef roast in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat, about 5
minutes on each side. Cover beef with beef stock, 2 tablespoons garlic, and 1
fluid ounce Scotch whiskey; braise over low heat until beef is tender, 3 to 4
hours.

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green
bell pepper, and 2 tablespoons garlic in the hot oil until lightly browned, 5
to 8 minutes. Add diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef suet, chili powder,
cumin, oregano, basil, fish sauce, lime juice, 1 fluid ounce Scotch whiskey,
and honey to onion mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer
for 3 to 4 hours.

Remove beef from braising liquid and shred. Stir braising liquid and shredded
beef into tomato mixture; simmer to blend flavors, about 1 more hour. Season
with hot sauce, salt, and black pepper.
