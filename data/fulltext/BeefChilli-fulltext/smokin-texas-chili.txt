Steps

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the
beef in 2 batches and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Remove the
beef from the saucepot.

Add the remaining oil and heat over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until
it's tender. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.

Add the salsa, water, chili powder and cumin. Heat to a boil. Return the beef
to the saucepot. Stir in the beans. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for
1 hour. Uncover and cook for 30 minutes or until the beef is fork-tender.

Sprinkle with the cilantro, if desired.
