Steps

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef until evenly
browned. Drain off grease, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

In a slow cooker, combine the cooked beef, kidney beans, tomatoes, celery, red
bell pepper, and red wine vinegar. Season with chili powder, cumin, parsley,
basil and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to distribute ingredients evenly.

Cook on High for 6 hours, or on Low for 8 hours. Pour in the wine during the
last 2 hours.
