Steps

In a stockpot over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no longer pink.
Drain off grease, reserving 2 tablespoons to remain in the pan. In a small
bowl, stir together the garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, and flour.
Sprinkle the mixture over the meat, and stir until the meat is evenly coated.

Stir the oregano into the meat mixture, then pour in the 2 cans of beef broth.
Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then add the cans of beans. If
you like your chili soupy, add only 2 cans of beans, but if you like thick
chili, use all three. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes to blend
flavors.
