Steps

Heat oil in medium, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add onions,
peppers and garlic; cook until vegetables are soft, stirring occasionally,
about 8 minutes. Season meat with Adobo. Add meat to the pot, breaking into
small pieces with a wooden spoon. Cook until browned, stirring occasionally,
about 8 minutes. Stir in chili powder, cilantro and cumin, cook until
fragrant, about 1 minute more.

Add 1 cup water, chopped tomatoes (with liquid), beef bouillon and Sazon to
pot. Bring tomato mixture to a boil. Lower heat to medium-low and simmer,
uncovered, until mixture thickens and flavors come together, stirring
occasionally, about 1 hour. Stir in beans. Cook until heated through, about 15
minutes more.

Divide chili among serving bowls. Garnish with cheese, sour cream and onions,
if desired.
