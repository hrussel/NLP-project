quinoa-chili

Steps

Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat
to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has
been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook
and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain
and discard any excess grease; set beef aside.

Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic,
and jalapeno pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned
translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with chili powder and cumin; cook 1
minute more to release the flavor of the spices. Stir in the tomatoes, black
beans, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, zucchini, oregano, and parsley.
Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Simmer until the bell peppers are
tender, about 20 minutes.

Once the red and green peppers are tender, stir in the quinoa, beef, and corn
kernels. Return to a simmer, and cook 5 minutes to reheat. Stir in the
cilantro to serve.
