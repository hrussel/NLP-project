Steps

Brown beef and onion in a large skillet over medium high heat. Place browned
mixture in a large pot and stir in the tomato sauce, garlic, Worcestershire
sauce, cinnamon, vinegar, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper.
Simmer, uncovered, over low heat for 1 1/2 hours.

When meat mixture has about 20 minutes cooking time left, bring a large pot of
lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or
until al dente; drain and set aside.

Serve meat mixture over cooked spaghetti topped with cheese, beans, olives and
chopped onion.
