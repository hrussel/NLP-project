Steps

Melt the bacon drippings in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions
and cook until they are translucent.

Combine the beef with the garlic, ground chile, chili powder and cumin. Add
this meat-and-spices to the onions in the pot. Break up any meat that sticks
together as you cook, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes, until meat is
evenly browned (very browned, not just gray). Sprinkle in Hungarian paprika
and oregano.

Pour in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, salt, parsley and jalapeno.
Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. NOTE:
True Texans DO NOT add beans to their chili, but my husband loves them, so
this is the point where you can add as many cans of drained and rinsed pinto
beans as you wish (I add 2 cans, but shhhhhh don't tell my Daddy!!!).

During cooking you may squeeze the jalapeno as it softens against the sides of
the pot to release more heat if desired.

Mix in the masa harina, and cook while stirring for 30 minutes longer, or
until desired consistency is achieved. Taste and adjust seasonings.
