Steps

Heat oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Stir in onions, green
peppers, green chilies, and garlic. Cook and stir until onions are soft and
translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the stew meat to the pot, cook until well
browned, about 5 minutes.

Stir the chili power, cumin, basil, cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper,
oregano, thyme, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick into the pot. Cook and stir until
spices are aromatic, about 2 minutes.

Pour the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, and beer into the pot; stir in the
tomato paste. Bring chili to a simmer and cook until beef is very tender and
the liquids have thickened, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Mix the chili beans and chocolate into the chili. Simmer until the chocolate
has melted and the chili is hot, 5 minutes. Remove cinnamon stick and bay
leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
