Steps

In a large saucepan over medium high heat, saute the ground beef for 5
minutes, or until browned. Stir in the onion and green bell pepper and saute
for 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Next, add the beans, mushrooms, brown sugar and chili powder to taste. Mix
together well, reduce heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes to 1 hour or
more, depending on how much time you have and how thick you like your chili.
