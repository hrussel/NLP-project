Steps

Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke
slightly. Pour in the olive oil, and tip the pan to coat. Add beef cubes; cook
and stir to brown on all sides. When the meat is pretty much browned, season
with chili powder, oregano, paprika and pepper. Stir the beef to coat with all
of the spices, and continue browning until spices become fragrant. Scrape all
of the beef out of the pan, and into a 3 1/2 quart slow cooker.

Pour the water into the skillet, and watch out! It will sizzle. Stir in the
beef bouillon, and scrape all of the bits of beef and spice off of the bottom
of the pan. When the bouillon is dissolved, and the bottom of the pan is
clear, pour the liquid into the slow cooker. Mix the eggplant and tomato paste
into the chili. Adjust the amount of liquid in the slow cooker if necessary by
adding water until it is within 1/2 inch of the top.

Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours, or on High for 3 to 4 hours. Low heat
is preferred if you have the time. Twenty minutes before serving, sift in the
flour, and stir in along with the salt. Allow to cook until thickened. Serve
with your favorite chili toppings.
