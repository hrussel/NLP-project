Steps

Heat olive oil in a heavy 6-quart pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion
until soft and pale gold in color, about 15 minutes. Stir chili powder, cocoa,
garlic, oregano, cumin, kosher salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into
onion. Cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.

Stir tomatoes and beer into the mixture until well-combined. Add ranch-style
beans, beef brisket, and beef broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low,
cover, and simmer chili, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender and
flavors have blended, about 30 minutes. Season with liquid smoke flavoring,
salt, and black pepper.

Preheat a waffle iron on medium according to manufacturer's instructions.

Whisk corn bread mix, egg, sour cream, and milk in a bowl to make a batter.
Pour about 1/2 cup batter, or as needed, onto hot waffle iron, close lid, and
bake waffle until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
Serve chili over hot waffles.
