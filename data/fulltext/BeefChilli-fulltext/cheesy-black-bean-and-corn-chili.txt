Steps

Place ground beef into a large skillet and cook, stirring often, until the
beef is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes. Stir in green onions after 5
minutes. Drain excess grease.

Place ground beef mixture into a large soup pot over medium heat.

Stir in black beans, corn and its liquid, chili seasoning mix, crushed
tomatoes, and water; stir to combine. If chili seems too thick, mix in a
little more water.

Cover the chili and cook 1 hour; add processed cheese cubes, allow to melt,
and stir into the chili until smooth just before serving.
