Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook onions, garlic, ground

Mix in the diced tomatoes with juice, dark beer, coffee, tomato paste and beef
broth. Season with brown sugar, chili powder, cumin, cocoa powder, oregano,
cayenne pepper, coriander and salt. Stir in 2 cans of the beans and hot chile
peppers. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.

Stir in the 2 remaining cans of beans, and simmer for another 30 minutes.
