Steps

Cook and stir ground beef in a large soup pot over medium heat until meat is
browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Pour kidney beans, beef bouillon, plum
tomatoes, tomato puree, beer, and Worcestershire sauce into beef. Stir in dry
onion soup mix, red pepper flakes, dried chipotle pepper, cumin, thyme, and
oregano.

Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until
thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
