Steps

Crumble the ground beef into a soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
until evenly browned. Drain off most of the grease. Add onion, red pepper
flakes, and half of the cumin; cook and stir until onion is tender.

Pour in the tomato soup, chicken broth, and crushed tomatoes. Season with
chili powder, salt and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes. Pour in the beans, and
season with remaining cumin and cayenne pepper; simmer for another 30 minutes.
Now enjoy.
