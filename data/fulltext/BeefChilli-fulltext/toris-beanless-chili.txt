Steps

Bring water to a boil in a large soup pot, reduce heat to low, and cook onions
in the simmering water until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Add ground beef to
onions; cook and stir until ground beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 more
minutes. Sprinkle beef with salt and black pepper as it cooks. Drain excess
grease.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bell peppers
in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add peppers to meat mixture.
Stir vegetable juice cocktail, diced tomatoes, tomato soup, chorizo sausage,
green chiles, chili powder, and adobo seasoning into mixture until combined.

Bring chili to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until thickened, about 30
minutes. Cover and continue simmering to blend flavors, about 20 minutes more.
