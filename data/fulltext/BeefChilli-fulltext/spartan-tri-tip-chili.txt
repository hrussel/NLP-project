Steps

Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices
on paper towels. Crumble bacon when cool enough to handle.

Heat vegetable oil in a large soup pot over medium heat and brown tri tip in
the hot oil, working in 4 batches, until beef is browned and no longer pink
inside, about 5 minutes per batch. Return all cooked beef to pot and stir
sweet onion, garlic, jalapeno peppers, chili powder, cumin, and paprika into
meat; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.

Pour tomatoes, beer, tequila, oregano, salt, and black pepper into mixture,
scraping up and dissolving any browned bits of food on the bottom of the pot.
Stir reserved bacon, beef stock, chipotle peppers, and steak sauce into the
mixture; bring to a boil.

Reduce heat to low and stir in Mexican-style corn and green bell pepper. Cover
and simmer chili, stirring occasionally, until thickened and meat is very
tender, about 3 hours.
