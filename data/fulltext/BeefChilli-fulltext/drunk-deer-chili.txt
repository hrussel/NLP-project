Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the venison, beef, and
pork in the melted butter until completely browned. Add the onion and
jalapeno; cook until tender. Season with chili powder, cayenne pepper, and
cumin.

Stir in the stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, garlic and beef bouillon. Pour the
bourbon, beer, and water into the mixture and stir. Bring the chili to a boil;
cover and reduce heat to medium-low; simmer about 1 hour, stirring frequently.
