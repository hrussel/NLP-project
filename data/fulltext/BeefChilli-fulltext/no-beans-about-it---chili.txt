Steps

Crumble the ground beef into a stock pot or large Dutch oven over medium-high
heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook stirring frequently until beef is
evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.

Season with chili powder, oregano, cumin and hot sauce. Stir in the tomatoes
and vinegar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 1
hour - or longer if you have time. Stir occasionally to prevent burning on the
bottom.
