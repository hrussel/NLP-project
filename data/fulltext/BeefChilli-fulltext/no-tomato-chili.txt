Steps

Crumble the ground beef into a soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
until browned. Drain off the grease, and season with salt to taste. Add the
onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir for about 3 minutes. Reduce the
heat to medium, and season with Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cumin and
oregano. Cook and stir for another 5 minutes.

Reduce heat to low, and stir in the chili sauce, beef broth, kidney beans and
cannellini beans. Cover, and simmer for about 35 minutes. Ladle into bowls to
serve, and top with shredded Cheddar cheese and jalapeno.
