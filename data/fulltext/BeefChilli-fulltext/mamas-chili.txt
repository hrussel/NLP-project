Steps

Place the tomatoes in a large pot and squash them with your hands. Add the
beans, onion, banana chile pepper, sugar, garlic powder and chili powder and
simmer for about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a separate large skillet over medium high heat, saute the ground
beef for 5 to 10 minutes, or until browned and crumbly. Drain the fat and add
the beef to the simmering pot. Stir in the cheese, if desired. Allow to simmer
for 1 more hour.
