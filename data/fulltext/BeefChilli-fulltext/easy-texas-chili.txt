Steps

Cook and stir the beef, onion, and bell pepper in a large pot over medium heat
until the beef is brown and onion and pepper are tender, about 10 minutes.
Drain grease from beef.

Stir in beans, tomatoes, tomato sauce, jalapenos (if using), chili powder, red
pepper flakes, black pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Bring mixture to a slow
boil; cover and reduce heat. Simmer chili at least 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally so that it does not stick. This chili can be simmered for several
hours; the longer you simmer, the more flavor you will get.
