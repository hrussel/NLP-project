Steps

Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Saute onions and bell pepper
until tender. Add garlic, ground beef and stew meat and cook until the meat is
no longer pink, about 10 minutes.

Add the tomatoes, beef broth and kidney beans to the stockpot, cover and bring
to a boil. Let the mixture boil for 4 to 5 minutes then stir in the chili
powder, Italian seasoning, salt and brown sugar. Simmer uncovered for about 2
hours, or until the chili thickens and beans are tender.
