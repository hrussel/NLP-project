Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in
the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, 8 minutes; drain.

Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter,
whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of
flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking
continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add
remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir
Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into
the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.

Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to
thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar
cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with
remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4
ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from
heat.

Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between
two 9x13-inch baking dishes.

Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese
in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the
potato chip mixture with cooking spray.

Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is
bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.
