Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in
the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.
Drain.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green
bell peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is softened, 5 to 10
minutes.

Mix tomatoes and their juices, tomato sauce, hot pepper sauce, chili powder,
cumin, cayenne pepper, and black pepper into onion mixture; bring to a boil.
Add kidney beans, black beans, and corn; reduce heat to low, cover skillet,
and simmer chili for 30 minutes.

Stir macaroni into chili, cover skillet, and simmer until macaroni is heated,
5 minutes; top with Cheddar cheese and green onions to serve.
