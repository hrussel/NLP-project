Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Place butternut squash, cut-side down, on a baking sheet.

Roast squash in the preheated oven until soft, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove squash
flesh from skin and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190
degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil
until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.

Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour and mustard into
melted butter until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk milk into flour
mixture until the mixture has the texture of heavy cream, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove from heat.

Stir butternut squash, white Cheddar cheese, and Cheddar cheese into milk
mixture until cheese is melted. Stir rotini into cheese mixture. Pour cheese
mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with bread crumbs.

Bake in the preheated oven until bread crumbs are golden, about 10 minutes.
