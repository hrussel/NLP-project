Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish
with cooking spray.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in
the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, 8 minutes. Drain; pour macaroni into the prepared dish.

Beat eggs, sour cream, seasoned salt, and black pepper into a smooth mixture;
stir Cheddar cheese and Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese into mixture until
thoroughly combined. Pour over macaroni and mix well. Top casserole with torn
pieces of processed cheese. Drizzle melted butter over casserole, especially
along the sides.

Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and cheese has melted,
about 30 minutes.
