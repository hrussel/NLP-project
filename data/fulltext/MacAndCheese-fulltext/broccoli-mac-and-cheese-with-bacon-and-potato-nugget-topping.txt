Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking
dish.

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat,
turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon
slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble the bacon and set aside. Heat 1
teaspoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the broccoli and
onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent,
about 5 minutes.

Whisk together the eggs, the remaining 1 teaspoon of butter, and milk in a
large bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and adobo seasoning. Stir in 1 cup of
Cheddar cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, the broccoli mixture and half of
the potato nuggets. Place macaroni into the baking dish and pour the cheese
mixture over the pasta, mixing well. Top with the remaining 1 cup of Cheddar
cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella, bacon, and potato nuggets. Cover with aluminum
foil.

Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
