Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 10x15-inch baking sheet
with cooking spray. Unroll pizza crust and place on the prepared baking pan.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in
the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, 8 minutes. Drain.

Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir flour with
butter until it has a slightly toasted fragrance, about 2 minutes. Whisk in
milk and simmer until thickened, whisking constantly, 2 more minutes. Stir in
processed cheese cubes. Let the cheese cubes melt, stirring often, to make a
smooth cheese sauce.

Spread about 3/4 cup of cheese sauce onto the pizza crust. Stir cooked
macaroni into remaining cheese sauce in the saucepan and spoon the macaroni
and cheese onto the crust in an even layer. Sprinkle top of pizza with
mozzarella cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is lightly browned and the
mozzarella cheese is golden brown, about 15 minutes.
