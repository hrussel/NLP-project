Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink.

Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and
stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to low, then stir in the flour, mustard, and salt until thoroughly
combined. Gradually stir in the milk, then increase heat to medium-high and
simmer until thickened, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes.

Stir in the Cheddar cheese and black pepper until cheese is melted and the
sauce is smooth, about 3 minutes. Stir in the macaroni until well-coated and
heated through.
