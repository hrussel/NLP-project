Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart casserole
dish.

Place torn rye bread into a food processor and pulse several times to make
crumbs; combine rye crumbs with panko crumbs in a bowl and set aside.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain noodles and set aside.

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir
onion until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and black
pepper; stir in brown mustard. Remove from heat, stir in flour until smooth,
and gradually whisk in milk. Sauce will thicken. Whisk 1 1/2 cup Swiss cheese
into the sauce, stirring until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth.
Stir sauerkraut with about 1 tablespoon of reserved juice and corned beef into
the cheese sauce.

Transfer cooked noodles to the prepared casserole dish and pour in the sauce;
stir to combine. Sprinkle remaining 1 1/2 cup Swiss cheese in an even layer
over the top.

Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 20 minutes. Remove
casserole from oven and set the oven to broil.

Stir 3 tablespoons melted butter into the reserved rye and panko crumbs until
thoroughly combined and sprinkle top of casserole with rye crumb mixture.
Return to oven and broil until the crumbs are golden brown, about 2 more
minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning.
