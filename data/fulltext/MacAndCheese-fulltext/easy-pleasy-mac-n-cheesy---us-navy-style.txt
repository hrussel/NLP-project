Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink. Transfer the macaroni to a large bowl, and stir in
the processed cheese cubes, Cheddar cheese soup, sour cream, Parmesan cheese,
milk, salt, and black pepper. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Mix the
cracker crumbs with the butter, and sprinkle over the casserole. Cover the
casserole with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 30 minutes; remove foil and
bake until crumbs are golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
