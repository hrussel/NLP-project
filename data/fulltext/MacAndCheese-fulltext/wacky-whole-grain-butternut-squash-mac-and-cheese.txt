Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Combine elbow macaroni and water in the bottom of a 9x11-inch baking dish.

Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into melted
butter until smooth. Gradually whisk milk into flour mixture; bring to a boil
and cook, stirring constantly, until smooth and thick, about 2 minutes.

Stir Cheddar cheese, American cheese, and Parmesan cheese into milk mixture
until cheeses are melted and mixture is smooth. Gradually stir butternut
squash soup into cheese mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Pour cheese mixture over elbow macaroni and stir to combine.

Bake in the preheated oven until top begins to brown, about 50 minutes. Let
cool for 10 minutes before serving.
