Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil
until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain pasta and return to
pot. Stir Alfredo sauce and 3/4 pound Cheddar cheese into pasta until cheese
begins to melt. Pour pasta mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with
bread crumbs and 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread crumbs are golden
brown, about 30 minutes.

Ingredients

1 pound rotini pasta

1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce

3/4 pound shredded Cheddar cheese

1/4 cup bread crumbs, or more to taste

2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste
