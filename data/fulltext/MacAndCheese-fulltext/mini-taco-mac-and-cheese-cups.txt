Steps

Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin-pan cups with foil
liners.

Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned,
stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Remove the skillet from the
heat.

Stir in the soup, salsa, corn, macaroni and 3/4 cup cheese. Spoon about 1/2
cup beef mixture into each muffin-pan cup. Sprinkle each with about 1
tablespoon remaining cheese.

Bake for 15 minutes or until the beef mixture is hot and the cheese is melted.
