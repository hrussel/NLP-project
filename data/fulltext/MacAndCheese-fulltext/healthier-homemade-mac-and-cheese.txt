Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly
salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in boiling water, stirring
occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour to
make a roux. Slowly add milk to roux, stirring constantly. Stir in Cheddar and
Parmesan cheeses and cook over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce is
thick, about 3 minutes. Place macaroni in large baking dish and pour sauce
over macaroni. Stir well.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and
stir until butter is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread over macaroni to cover.
Sprinkle with paprika.

Bake in preheated oven until cheese sauce is hot and breadcrumbs are browned,
about 30 minutes.
