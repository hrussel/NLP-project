Steps

Stir the condensed soup and water together in a slow cooker until smooth. Add
the shell pasta and andouille sausage. Set the slow cooker to High; cook 2
hours, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.

Once the pasta is tender, stir in the sour cream, Cheddar, and mozzarella
until the cheeses melt. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from
heat, and allow to rest 15 minutes before serving.
