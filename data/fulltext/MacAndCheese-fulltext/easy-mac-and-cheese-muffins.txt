Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with
nonstick cooking spray. In a small bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, olive
oil and salt; set aside.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook
for about 8 minutes, it should still be a little bit firm. Remove from the
heat, drain and return to the pan; stir in the butter and egg until pasta is
evenly coated. Reserve 1/2 cup of sharp Cheddar cheese and stir the remaining
Cheddar cheese, milk and mozzarella cheese into the pasta. Spoon into the
prepared muffin tin. Sprinkle the reserved cheese and the bread crumb mixture
over the tops.

Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the topping is nicely
browned. Allow the muffins to cool for a few minutes before removing from the
pan. This will allow the cheese to set and they will hold their muffin shape.
