Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and stir in macaroni from
the packages, retaining cheese mix packets for later use. Cook macaroni at a
rolling boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until tender but still
slightly firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse macaroni with cold water.
Return cooked macaroni to the pot.

Mix butter, chicken broth, and tomatoes with macaroni and bring mixture to a
simmer over medium heat; stir in garlic powder, cumin, dry mustard, pepper,
and contents of cheese mix packets. Stir in milk and reduce heat to low; heat
soup almost to a simmer. Do not boil.

Serve soup in bowls and top each serving with about 2 tablespoons of sour
cream.
