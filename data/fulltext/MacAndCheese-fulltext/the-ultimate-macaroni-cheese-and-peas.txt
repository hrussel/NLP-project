Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cook macaroni according to package directions;
drain. Cover and keep warm.

Meanwhile, for cheese sauce, melt the 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat in
a medium saucepan. Stir in flour, mustard, salt and pepper until combined. Add
milk all at once. Cook and stir for 5 minutes or until thick and bubbly. Cook
and stir for 2 more minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.

Add cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, stirring until cheese is melted and sauce
is smooth. Stir cheese sauce and canned peas into the cooked macaroni. Heat
through. Pour into a greased 2-quart baking dish.

Combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese and the 2 teaspoons melted butter in a
small bowl. Sprinkle over macaroni. Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until
topping is golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
