Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish
with parchment paper.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling
water, stirring occasionally until almost cooked through and firm to the bite,
about 7 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Sprinkle macaroni with
1/2 teaspoon salt and stir 1/2 cup butter into the pasta.

Mix 1/4 cup butter, sour cream, cream cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese, and egg
yolk together in a bowl. Stir flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cayenne pepper, and
milk into the sour cream mixture.

Spread 1/4 cup sour cream sauce over bottom of prepared baking dish. Stir
remaining sour cream sauce into macaroni. Pour macaroni into baking dish atop
sauce layer; sprinkle mild Cheddar cheese over the casserole.

Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese topping has melted,
about 15 minutes.
