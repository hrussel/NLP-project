Steps

Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the
hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard
grease.

Return skillet to heat. Stir salsa, taco seasoning mix, and black pepper into
the beef; simmer the mixture until hot, about 5 minutes.

Stir water, macaroni, and milk into the beef mixture; bring to a boil, reduce
heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and simmer the mixture until
the pasta is tender, about 10 minutes.

Stir cheese food and Cheddar cheese into the pasta mixture; cook until the
cheese melts completely, 5 to 7 minutes.
