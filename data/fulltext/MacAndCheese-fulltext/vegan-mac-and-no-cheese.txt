Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook
for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Transfer to a medium baking
dish.

Heat vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion, and
cook until tender and lightly browned. Gently mix with the macaroni.

In a blender or food processor, mix cashews, lemon juice, water, and salt.
Gradually blend in canola oil, roasted red peppers, nutritional yeast, garlic
powder, and onion powder. Blend until smooth. Thoroughly mix with the macaroni
and onions.

Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. Cool 10 to 15
minutes before serving.
