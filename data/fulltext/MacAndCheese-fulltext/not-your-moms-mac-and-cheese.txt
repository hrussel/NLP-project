Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the gemelli, and return to a
boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked
through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a
colander set in the sink. Add olive oil, and toss pasta until coated; set
aside.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Season
with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly
browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess
grease. Set aside.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Heat 3 tablespoons butter and the flour in a large skillet over low heat. Cook
and stir until the butter is melted and the flour is incorporated, then slowly
whisk in the milk. Stir in the fontina cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese, white
Cheddar cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese; cook, whisking constantly, until
cheese is melted and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with paprika,
nutmeg, garlic powder, cinnamon, and chili powder. Season to taste with salt
and black pepper. Stir in the pasta and beef, and transfer mixture to a large
baking dish.

Combine 2 tablespoons butter, bread crumbs, and the remaining 2 tablespoons
Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Sprinkle mixture over the pasta in the baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 12 minutes, then set the oven
on broil. Broil until lightly browned, about 3 more minutes.
