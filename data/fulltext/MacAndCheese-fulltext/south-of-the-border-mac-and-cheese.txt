Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini at a boil
until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.

Combine the rotini pasta, evaporated milk, American cheese, Cheddar cheese,
canned green chiles, and chili powder in a slow cooker.

Cook on High, stirring twice, for 2 hours.

Stir tomatoes and green onions through the pasta mixture.

Continue cooking until the tomatoes are hot, 5 to 10 minutes.
