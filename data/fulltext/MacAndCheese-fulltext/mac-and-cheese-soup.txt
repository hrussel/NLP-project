Steps

Place the chopped bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain the
bacon on a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve 1 teaspoon of the bacon drippings.

Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high
heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil.
Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked
through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a
colander set in the sink.

Heat reserved bacon drippings in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook
the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes; stir in the garlic, and cook
until the garlic is softened, about 2 more minutes. Mix in bacon bits, chicken
broth, cheese sauce, chicken bouillon granules, ground red chili pepper, black
pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and cooked macaroni. Bring to a boil and
reduce heat to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors have
blended, about 5 minutes.
