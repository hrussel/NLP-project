Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole
dish.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in
the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, 8 minutes. Drain.

Stir soup, evaporated milk, Colby cheese, and chipotle chile into the cooked
pasta until well combined. Spoon mixture into the prepared casserole dish.

Stir together panko bread crumbs and olive oil in a small bowl. Sprinkle bread
crumb mixture over the top of casserole.

Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and the casserole is
bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.
