Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in
the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, 8 minutes. Drain.

Combine potato chip crumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, bread crumbs, and
butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until golden brown, about
5 minutes. Set aside.

Heat prepared white sauce, Cheddar cheese, Gruyere cheese, and dry mustard in
a large saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until cheese melts, 3 to 4
minutes. Remove from heat.

Combine cooked macaroni and cheese together in a large bowl. Spoon mixture
into 4 (10-ounce) ramekins and cover with toasted potato chip topping.
