Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place macaroni in the
pot, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large
casserole dish.

Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly
brown. Drain grease. Mix in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and sloppy joe
seasoning. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes.

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, and
cook until tender. Mix in flour, mustard, salt, and pepper. In a bowl, mix the
half and half and Worcestershire sauce. Gradually whisk half and half mixture
into the pot. Bring to a boil, and cook 1 minute, until slightly thickened.
Remove from heat. Mix in 3 cups of cheese. Stir cooked pasta into the pot,
evenly coating with the sauce. Transfer to the casserole dish. Layer with the
beef mixture and top with remaining cheese.

Cover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, and continue
baking 10 minutes, until bubbly.
