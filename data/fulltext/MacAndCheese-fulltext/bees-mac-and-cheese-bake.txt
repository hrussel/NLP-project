Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large
casserole dish.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in shell pasta and
cook 12 minutes, or until tender but still firm. Drain, and transfer to a
large bowl.

Mix cream of mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese, and pimentos with the pasta. Pour
into the prepared casserole dish. Top with crushed crackers.

Cover dish, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, and
continue baking 15 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and crackers are lightly
browned.
