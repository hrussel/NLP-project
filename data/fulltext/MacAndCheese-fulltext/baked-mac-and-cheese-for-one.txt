Steps

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an oven-proof soup
crock or 1 cup baking dish.

Fill a small saucepan with water, and bring to a boil. Stir in the macaroni;
boil until cooked but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well, and
reserve.

In the same saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the
flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, and milk; whisk until smooth. Cook,
stirring, for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and whisk in 1/3 cup cheese,
mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Stir in the cooked macaroni.
Spoon the macaroni and cheese into the prepared dish. Sprinkle with bread
crumbs and 1 tablespoon cheddar cheese.

Bake, uncovered, until the cheese is melted and the macaroni is heated
through, about 10 minutes.
