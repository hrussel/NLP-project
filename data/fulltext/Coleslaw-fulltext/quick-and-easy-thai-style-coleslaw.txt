Steps

Pour the coleslaw mix into a large bowl. Pour in the lime juice, rice vinegar,
fish sauce, sesame oil, honey, and peanuts. Stir until well blended. If you
have a bowl with a lid, put the lid on and shake thoroughly. Taste, and season
with salt and pepper. Refrigerate for a few hours, stirring or shaking
occasionally, to allow the flavors to blend before serving.
