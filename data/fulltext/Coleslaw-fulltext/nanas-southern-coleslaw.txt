Steps

Mix cabbage, carrots, and onion in a large salad bowl. Whisk mayonnaise,
sugar, milk, buttermilk, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and black pepper in a
separate bowl until smooth and the sugar has dissolved.

Pour dressing over cabbage mixture and mix thoroughly. Cover bowl and
refrigerate slaw at least 2 hours (the longer the better). Mix again before
serving.
