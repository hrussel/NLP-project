Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray.

Cook the cabbage, red cabbage, and carrots in the hot skillet until they begin
to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and
pepper. Continue to cook and stir until cabbage and carrots are soft, 8 to 10
minutes. Stir balsamic vinegar into the cabbage mixture just before removing
from heat.
