Steps

Place ramen noodles in colander; break into quarters. Pour boiling water over
noodles to soften slightly. Use a fork to separate noodles. Rinse quickly with
cold water; drain.

Make a dressing by whisking together the flavor packet from the ramen noodles,
olive oil, vinegar, and sweetener in a bowl. Place the ramen noodles, coleslaw
mix, green onions, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl; toss to combine.
Drizzle dressing over the coleslaw mixture and continue to toss until entire
mixture is coated with dressing. Chill for 2 hours before serving.
