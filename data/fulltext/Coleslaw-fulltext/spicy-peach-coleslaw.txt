Whisk mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Asian chile sauce, lemon juice, rice vinegar,
vegetable oil, and sugar in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Season with salt
and cayenne pepper.

Place cabbage into a large bowl; add peaches and 1 tablespoon chives. Lightly
toss until combined. Pour dressing over coleslaw and stir until coated.

Cover coleslaw with plastic wrap and chill until flavors have developed and
