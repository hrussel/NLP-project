Steps

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir sunflower
kernels and ramen noodles in hot butter until sunflower kernels are lightly
browned and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer into a
bowl to cool.

Stir sunflower seeds and ramen noodles with napa cabbage and spring onions in
a large salad bowl. Whisk vinegar, vegetable oil, sugar, and soy sauce
together in a separate bowl until sugar has dissolved; pour dressing over
salad and toss.
