Steps

Cut the cabbages in half lengthwise and trim the ends. Rinse and cut into
pieces about 2 inch square. Place the cabbage into large resealable bags and
sprinkle salt on the leaves so they are evenly coated. Use your hands to rub
the salt in to the leaves. Seal the bags and leave at room temperature for 6
hours.

Rinse the salt from the cabbage leaves and then drain and squeeze out any
excess liquid. Place the cabbage in a large container with a tight fitting
lid. Stir in the fish sauce, green onions, white onion, garlic, sugar and
ginger. Sprinkle the Korean chile powder over the mixture. Wear plastic gloves
to protect your hands and rub the chile powder into the cabbage leaves until
evenly coated. Seal the container and set in a cool dry place. Leave
undisturbed for 4 days. Refrigerate before serving, and store in the
refrigerator for up to 1 month (if it lasts that long!).
