Steps

In a large bowl, toss together the coleslaw mix, green onions and broccoli.
Set aside.

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Crumble the ramen noodles
into a bowl, and mix with the almonds and sunflower seeds. Sprinkle the
seasoning packets over all. Add to the skillet; cook and stir until noodles
and nuts are toasted, about 8 minutes.

In a jar with a tight fitting lid, combine the sugar, vinegar, oil and soy
sauce. Seal, and shake vigorously to blend.

Just before serving, combine the slaw mixture with the nuts and noodles. Pour
the dressing over all, and stir briefly to coat.
