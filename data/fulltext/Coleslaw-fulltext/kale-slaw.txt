kale-slaw

Steps

Toss kale with carrot, orange juice, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper in a
large salad bowl, using your hands to rub orange and lemon juice into kale
leaves. Let stand a few minutes to absorb flavors.

Fill a bowl with ice water. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil and stir onion
into boiling water; cook just until starting to soften, 15 to 30 seconds.
Drain and immediately immerse onion in ice water. Drain ice water, blot onion
dry on paper towels, and add to kale. Stir bacon, mayonnaise, and olive oil
into kale mixture and toss to coat. Can be made several hours ahead of time
and refrigerated until serving time.
