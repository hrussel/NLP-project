Steps

Mix canola oil, red wine vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar in a large bowl, mixing
until sugar has dissolved. Toss cabbage, green onions, almonds, and sunflower
seed kernels into the dressing. Cover bowl and refrigerate at least 1 hour
before serving; slaw tastes better when chilled overnight.

1/4 cup red wine vinegar

1 tablespoon soy sauce

6 tablespoons white sugar

1 (8 ounce) package shredded cabbage

3 green onions, thinly sliced
