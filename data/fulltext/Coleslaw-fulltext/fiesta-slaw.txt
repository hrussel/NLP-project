Steps

Heat a small skillet over medium heat; toast chipotle pepper in the skillet,
occasionally shaking the skillet, until pepper is fragrant and pliable, 3 to 5
minutes.

Use scissors to cut pepper and remove stem and seeds and transfer pepper in a
small bowl. Pour boiling water over pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and
allow pepper to rehydrate and soften, about 5 minutes. Drain and mince pepper;
set aside. Place the pineapple concentrate, olive oil, lime zest and juice,
and minced garlic in a separate bowl.

Toast the cumin seeds over medium heat for a minute or two in the same skillet
used for the chipotle pepper. Add cumin and reserved minced chipotle pepper to
pineapple olive oil mixture; stir to combine.

Combine the pineapple chunks, green cabbage, and red cabbage, cilantro, and
red bell pepper in a bowl. Add the dressing mix and toss thoroughly. Season
with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour before
serving, stirring occasionally.
