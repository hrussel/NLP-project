freezer-slaw

Steps

Combine cabbage, green bell pepper, onion, and carrots in a large bowl. Mix
boiling water and salt together in a bowl and pour over cabbage mixture. Set
aside for salt to draw out extra water from vegetables, about 1 hour. Drain
well.

Mix sugar, 1 cup water, cider vinegar, and celery seed in a saucepan; bring to
a boil. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove
saucepan from heat and cool completely.

Pour cooled sugar-vinegar mixture over drained cabbage mixture in a large bowl
and toss until slaw is well mixed. Spoon slaw into resealable plastic bags and
freeze.
