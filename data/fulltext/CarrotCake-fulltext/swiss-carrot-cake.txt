swiss-carrot-cake

Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch
square baking dish or 9 inch Bundt pan.

In a large bowl, whip egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer until light
and fluffy. Stir in the almonds, carrots,1 lemon's juice and zest, flour and
baking powder. In a separate bowl with a clean beater, whip egg whites with a
pinch of salt until they can hold a peak. Fold egg whites into the carrot
batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan.

Bake for 50 minutes, or until a small knife inserted into the center comes out
clean. For icing, mix the remaining lemon's juice with confectioners' sugar
until it can be drizzled easily from a spoon. Pour over the cake while warm or
cooled. If making in a Bundt pan, remove from the pan before glazing.
