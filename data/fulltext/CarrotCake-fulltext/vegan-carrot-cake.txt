Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9x13 inch baking pan
with cooking spray. Whisk together the whole wheat flour, soy flour, cinnamon,
ground cloves, baking soda, tapioca starch, and salt in a bowl until blended;
set aside.

Pour the hot water into a mixing bowl, and sprinkle with the flax meal. Stir
for a minute until the flax begins to absorb the water, and the mixture
slightly thickens. Stir in the brown sugar and vanilla until the sugar has
dissolved, then add the currants, carrots, and almonds. Stir in the dry
mixture until just moistened, then pour into the prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes
out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to
cool completely on a wire rack.
