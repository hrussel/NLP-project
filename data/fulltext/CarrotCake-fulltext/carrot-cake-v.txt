Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch
round pans.

In a large bowl, combine sugar and oil; beat well. Add eggs, carrots, and 1
teaspoon vanilla; beat mixture until smooth. Combine flour, salt, soda, and
spices; add to creamed mixture, beating well. Pour batter into prepared pans.

Bake for 30 minutes, or until cake tests done. Cool in pans for 10 minutes,
and then transfer layers to wire racks.

To Make Cream Cheese Frosting: Combine cream cheese and butter or margarine,
beating until light and fluffy. Add 1 tablespoon vanilla and confectioners'
sugar; beat until smooth. Stir in chopped pecans. Fill and frost the cake with
cream cheese frosting. Garnish with pecans, if desired.
