Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.

Beat the oil and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add eggs, one
at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the oil mixture before adding the
next.

Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl;
beat into the wet mixture. Fold grated carrots through the batter, mixing just
enough to evenly combine. Pour batter into the prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes
out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to
cool completely on a wire rack.
