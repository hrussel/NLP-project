Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 10x15x2 inch baking
dish or 10 inch Bundt pan with cooking spray.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
cinnamon and nutmeg. Set aside. In a separate larger bowl, mix together the
eggs, sugar and vanilla by hand. Stir in the oil; the mixture should resemble
pudding. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients, then fold in the carrots,
pineapple coconut, walnuts and raisins. Pour the batter into the prepared pan,
and spread evenly.

Bake for 55 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a small knife
inserted into the cake comes out clean.
