Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 10 inch

In a large bowl, beat eggs until light. Gradually beat in the white sugar, oil
and vanilla. Stir in the pineapple. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and
cinnamon, stir into the wet mixture until absorbed. Finally stir in the carrot
mixture and the walnuts. Pour evenly into the prepared pans.

cooled, frost with cream cheese frosting.
