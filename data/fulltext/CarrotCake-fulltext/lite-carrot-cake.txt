Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour one

Separate eggs and beat egg whites until frothy, then continue whipping and
gradually add 1/2 cup of the white sugar. Beat until stiff.

In a large bowl combine; the cake flour, wheat flour, brown sugar, baking
powder, baking soda, and cinnamon, mix until blended. Add the oil and the
buttermilk and mix well. Add the egg yolks and mix well. Fold in the egg
whites and then the carrots. Pour batter into prepared pan.

Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 35 minutes. Cool and frost
