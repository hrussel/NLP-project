flax-seed-carrot-cake

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x5 inch loaf pan
with vegetable cooking spray.

Whisk together the egg whites, sugar, milk, applesauce, vanilla, and almond
extract in a small bowl; mix until well blended. In a large bowl, sift
together the flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves,
and baking soda. Mix the egg into the flour; stir until well blended. Fold in
the walnuts, raisins, carrot, and drained pineapple. Pour batter into the
prepared pan.

Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
clean (but not necessarily dry), about 40 minutes. Set aside to cool for 10 to
20 minutes before refrigerating overnight.
