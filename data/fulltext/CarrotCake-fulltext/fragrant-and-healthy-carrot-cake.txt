Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch Bundt pan.

In a large bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, cake flour, brown sugar,
cinnamon, carob, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Make a well in the
center and pour in the molasses, oil, eggs and orange juice. Mix until the dry
ingredients are moistened, then stir in the orange zest, lemon zest, raisins,
figs, poppy seeds, carrots and pecans until evenly distributed. Pour into the
prepared pan.

Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife
inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool for 30 minutes
before removing from the pan.
