Steps

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 4 cookie
sheets.

Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a
mixing bowl; set aside.

To make the cookie dough, beat 1/2 cup butter, shortening, white sugar, and
brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add 1 egg and
allow to blend into the butter mixture before adding the second egg and the
vanilla. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the crushed
pineapple, carrot, raisins, and chopped walnuts, mixing just enough to evenly
combine. Drop onto the prepared baking sheets by the heaping teaspoonful,
allowing 2 inches of space between the cookies.

Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow
the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire
rack to cool completely.

To make the frosting, beat the cream cheese and 1 tablespoon of butter with an
electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Add the confectioners' sugar and
pineapple juice. Beat until no lumps remain. Spread the frosting on the cooled
cookies, and allow to dry completely before storing.
