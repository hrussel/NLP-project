Steps

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

Generously grease 2 9-inch round cake pans.

Stir almond flour, sea salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and nutmeg together in a
large bowl.

Beat eggs, agave nectar, and grapeseed oil together in a separate large bowl.

Stir carrots, raisins, and walnuts into the egg mixture.

Stir carrot mixture into flour mixture to form a batter; pour into prepared
cake pans.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes
out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing
to cool completely on a wire rack.
