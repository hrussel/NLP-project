Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Stir in carrots.
Fold in pecans. Pour into prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted
into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes,
then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

To Make Frosting: In a medium bowl, combine butter, cream cheese,
confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until the mixture is smooth
