Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking
dish.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon,
nutmeg, and ginger. In a large bowl, stir together the honey, buttermilk,
eggs, oil and 2 teaspoons of vanilla until well blended. Add the flour mixture
to the buttermilk mixture, and stir until all of the dry ingredients are
absorbed. Stir in the carrot, pineapple, and walnuts by hand. Pour into the
prepared pan.

Bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into
the center comes out clean. Cool completely before frosting with cream cheese
frosting.

To make the frosting, mix together the cream cheese, honey and 1 teaspoon of
vanilla until smooth and well blended. Spread over the cooled cake.
