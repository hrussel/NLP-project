Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Sift
together the flour, baking soda and cinnamon. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the sugar and oil until blended. Beat in the eggs one
at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Stir in the flour mixture just until
incorporated. Fold in the pineapple, carrots, coconut and walnuts. Pour batter
into prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into
the center of the cake comes out clean. While still warm, poke holes in the
cake with a fork.

For the glaze: In a saucepan, combine butter, sugar, buttermilk and vanilla.
Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat and cook for 5
minutes. Pour glaze over warm cake, then allow to cool completely.
