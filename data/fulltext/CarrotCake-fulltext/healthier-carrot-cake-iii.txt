large bowl. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Stir
in carrots. Fold in pecans. Pour into prepared pan.

Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes

onto a wire rack and cool completely.

To make frosting: Combine butter, Neufchatel cheese, confectioner's sugar, and
1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Beat until mixture is smooth and creamy. Stir in
