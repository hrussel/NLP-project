Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.

Whisk vegetable oil, white sugar, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
together in a bowl until smooth.

Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl.

Stir oil mixture into flour mixture until a well-mixed batter forms.

Fold carrots, pineapple, coconut, and walnuts into batter; pour into prepared
baking pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
clean, about 1 hour; cool completely, about 1 hour.

Whisk confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and a dash vanilla extract
together in a bowl until well blended; spread over cooled cake.
