Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9 inch
round cake pans.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cocoa,
set aside. In another bowl, stir together the eggs, vanilla and oil. Stir in
the dry ingredients until they are completely absorbed. Fold in the carrots
and pineapple. Pour the batter evenly between the three prepared pans.

Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes
out clean. To make the frosting, combine the cream cheese, butter and
confectioners sugar in a medium bowl. Beat until smooth, then stir in the
coconut and nuts. Frost cake when cool.
