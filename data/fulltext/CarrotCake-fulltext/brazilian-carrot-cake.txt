Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 9x13 baking
dish.

Place the carrots, eggs, and oil in a blender or bowl of a food processor.
Process until carrots are finely chopped. Pour the carrot mixture into a
mixing bowl. Stir in 2 cups sugar until well blended. Stir in the flour and
baking powder; mix until well blended. Pour the batter into the prepared
baking dish.

Bake in preheated oven until top springs back when lightly touched, about 40
minutes.

Meanwhile, make the icing by placing the butter, 1 cup sugar, instant hot
chocolate drink mix, and milk in a pan. While stirring, heat to almost boiling
over medium-high heat until mixture thickens. When the cake is done, remove
from the oven and immediately spread the icing evenly over the top.
