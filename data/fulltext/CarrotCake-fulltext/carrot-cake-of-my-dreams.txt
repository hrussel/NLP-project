Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).

Combine flour, white sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and
ginger in a large bowl.

Whisk drained pineapple, brown sugar, egg substitute, vegetable oil, and
vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until smooth.

Stir pineapple mixture, carrots, zucchini, and raisins into flour mixture just
until flour is moistened.

Pour batter into the prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out
clean, 55 to 65 minutes.

Cool in the pan for 10 minutes; remove cake from pan and cool completely on a
wire rack, about 30 minutes.

Whisk reserved pineapple juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, with confectioners'
sugar until a spreadable glaze forms. Drizzle over cooled cake.
