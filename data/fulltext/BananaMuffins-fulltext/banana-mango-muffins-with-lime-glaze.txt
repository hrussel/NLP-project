banana-mango-muffins-with-lime-glaze

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper
liners.

Blend mango, bananas, brown sugar, and juice of 1/2 lime in a blender until
smooth.

Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice
together in a bowl. Mix butter, eggs, and mango-banana mixture into flour
mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a
muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes
before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Whisk confectioners' sugar, water, and 1 teaspoon lime juice together until
glaze is smooth and thick; spoon onto cooled muffins.
