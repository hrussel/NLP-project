Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat 12 (2/6.5 cm) non-
stick muffin pan cups with cooking spray.

In medium bowl, combine cereal and milk. Let stand for about 2 minutes or
until cereal softens.

In large bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda
and salt. Set aside.

Add egg, oil and mashed bananas to cereal mixture; beat well. Add liquid
mixture to dry ingredients, stirring only until just combined. Fold in
chocolate chips. Portion batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Top each cup
with a reserved banana slice.

Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until tops spring back when lightly
touched.
