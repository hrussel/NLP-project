Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 16 muffin cups or line
with paper liners.

Whisk flour, bran, rolled oats, flax seeds, baking powder, baking soda,
cinnamon, salt, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Mix bananas
and peanut oil together in a separate large bowl; stir dry ingredients into
banana mixture. Fold walnuts, chocolate chips, and raisins into batter. Spoon
batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full.

Bake muffins in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown and a knife
inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
