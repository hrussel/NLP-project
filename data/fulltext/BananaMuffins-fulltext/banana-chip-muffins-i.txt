Steps

Measure flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and chocolate chips into a large
bowl. Mix thoroughly, and make a well in the center.

Beat the egg in a small bowl until frothy. Mix in cooking oil, milk, and
bananas. Pour mixture into the well. Stir only to moisten. Batter will be
lumpy. Fill greased muffin cups 3/4 full.

Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes.
