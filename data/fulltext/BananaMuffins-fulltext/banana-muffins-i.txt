Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with
paper muffin liners.

Mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl,
beat together banana, sugar, egg and vanilla. Stir in the sour cream. Stir
banana mixture into flour until just combined. Scoop batter into prepared
muffin cups.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted
into center of a muffin comes out clean. Let cool before serving. For best
flavor, place in an airtight container or bag overnight.
