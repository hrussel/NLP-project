Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12 cup muffin pan
with paper liners or coat with cooking spray.

In a large bowl, stir together the bananas, brown sugar, egg, vanilla and oil.
Combine the whole wheat flour, oats, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder and
baking soda; stir into the banana mixture until blended. Spoon the batter into
the prepared muffin cups.

Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed,
about 25 minutes. Cool for a few minutes in the pan before attempting to
remove them.
