Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or
line with paper muffin liners. Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together
in a bowl; set aside.

Beat the bananas, butter, and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl
until smooth. Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, and whiskey. Mix in the flour
mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the coconut and chocolate chips,
mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour into muffin pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes
out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing
to cool completely on a wire rack.
