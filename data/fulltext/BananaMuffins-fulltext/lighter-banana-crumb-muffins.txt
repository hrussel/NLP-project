Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line
with paper liners.

Whisk 1 1/2 cup flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Beat
bananas, 3/4 cup brown sugar, agave syrup, egg, and 1/3 cup applesauce in a
separate bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir banana mixture into the dry
ingredients to make a smooth batter. Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full of
batter.

Mix 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, and cinnamon in a bowl; stir 1
1/2 teaspoons of applesauce into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle topping over muffins.

Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted
into center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.
