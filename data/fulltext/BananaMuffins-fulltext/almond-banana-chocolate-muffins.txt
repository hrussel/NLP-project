Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare a muffin tin with paper liners.

Prepare muffins according to package instructions using water, eggs and oil,
but use only 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup, and add 1/4 cup applesauce. Stir
in banana, 3/4 cup almonds and chocolate. Divide evenly among muffin cups and
sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup almonds.

Bake 15-20 minutes, until a tester comes out clean. Cool muffin tin on a rack
for 10 minutes, then remove muffins and continue cooling on rack. Store air
tight at room temperature for up to 4 days.
