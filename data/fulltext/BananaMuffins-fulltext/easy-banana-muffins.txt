Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 16 muffin cups with
cooking spray.

Sift all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and
salt together in a large bowl.

Mix bananas, white sugar, canola oil, brown sugar, and egg together in a
separate large bowl; fold banana mixture into flour mixture until just
incorporated. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups.

Bake in the preheated oven until muffins spring back when lightly tapped in
the middle, 14 to 16 minutes.
