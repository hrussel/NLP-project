Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with
cooking spray.

Mix mashed bananas and brown sugar together in a large bowl. Add eggs, olive
oil, and vanilla extract; mix well.

Mix flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Stir
banana mixture into flour mixture. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into
batter. Distribute batter into the muffin cups.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a
muffin comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
