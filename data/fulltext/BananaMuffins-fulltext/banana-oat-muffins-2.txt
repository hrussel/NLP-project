Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line
with paper muffin liners.

Place 1 cup rolled oats in a food processor and process until ground. In a
large bowl, combine ground oats with flour, 1 tablespoon rolled oats, chopped
walnuts, baking powder, cinnamon and salt.

In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and
fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the banana and vanilla.
Stir in sour cream. Mix oat/flour mixture into egg mixture. Spoon batter into
prepared muffin pans.

To make Topping: In a small bowl, combine 1/3 cup rolled oats, brown sugar,
cinnamon. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; stir in 1/4 cup
chopped walnuts. Generously sprinkle muffins with topping.

Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown and a
toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.
