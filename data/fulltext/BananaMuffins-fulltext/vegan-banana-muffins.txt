Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line
with paper liners.

Mix flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda,
nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir bananas, canola oil, and
coconut milk together in a separate bowl; mix banana mixture into flour
mixture until just combined. Fill muffin cups with batter.

Bake in the preheated oven until a tooth pick inserted in the center of a
muffin comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
