Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line
with paper muffin liners.

Whisk together flour, oats, flax, sugar, coconut, cinnamon, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt in a bowl.

Whisk together bananas, sour cream, applesauce, melted butter, eggs, and
vanilla in a large bowl. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture just until all
dry ingredients are moistened; fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes
out clean, about 20 minutes.
