Steps

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two twelve-cup
muffin tins.

In a mixing bowl, mix bananas, 1/2 cup brown sugar, honey, rum, and cognac
with an electric mixer until smooth.

In a large bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder, and
salt. In another bowl, cream white sugar, 2/3 cup brown sugar, eggs, and
melted butter. Pour banana mixture and creamed egg mixture into the flour, and
stir until just combined. Spoon mixture into muffin tins, filling cups 3/4
full.

In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, and
cinnamon. Cut in 3 tablespoons butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle over batter in muffin tins.

Bake muffins in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until done.
