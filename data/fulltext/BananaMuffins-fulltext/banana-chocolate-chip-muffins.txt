Steps

In a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder and baking powder.

In another bowl, blend the bananas, oil and egg together. Add to dry
ingredients, mixing just until blended. Fold in the chocolate chips. Spoon the
batter into a greased muffin pan, filling three-fourths full.

Bake in a preheated 425 degree F(220 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove
the muffins to a wire rack to cool completely.
