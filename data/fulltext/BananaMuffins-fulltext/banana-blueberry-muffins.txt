Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup muffin
pan.

In a large bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking
powder, and baking soda. In a separate bowl, mix the bananas, egg whites, and
vanilla extract.

Mix the banana mixture into the flour mixture until smooth. Fold in the
blueberries. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin pan.

Bake 16 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the
center of a muffin comes out clean.
