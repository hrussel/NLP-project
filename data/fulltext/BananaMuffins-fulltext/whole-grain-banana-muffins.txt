Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.

In a large bowl, whisk together whole wheat flours, oat bran, sugar, baking
powder, and salt. Stir in raisins. In another bowl, mix together yogurt, sour
cream, applesauce, maple syrup, egg whites, vanilla, and bananas. Pour yogurt
mixture into flour mixture, and mix just enough to combine. Spoon batter into
muffin cups. Sprinkle one teaspoon pecans over batter in each cup.

Bake muffins in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven, and
transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool.
