Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 10 muffin cups,
or line with muffin papers.

In a large bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder and
salt. In another bowl, beat together bananas, sugar, egg and melted butter.
Stir the banana mixture into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon
batter into prepared muffin cups.

In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and cinnamon.
Cut in 1 tablespoon butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle
topping over muffins.

Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into
center of a muffin comes out clean.
