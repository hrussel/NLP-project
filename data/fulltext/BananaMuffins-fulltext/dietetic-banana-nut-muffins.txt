Steps

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin tin,
or line with paper muffin liners.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar substitute, baking powder,
baking soda, and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, mix together the egg whites,
mashed banana and applesauce. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and mix
until just blended. Fill prepared muffin cups 3/4 full.

Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top springs back
when lightly touched. Allow muffins to cool in the pan over a wire rack for a
little while before tapping them out of the pan.
