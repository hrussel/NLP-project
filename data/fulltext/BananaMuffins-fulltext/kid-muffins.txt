Steps

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups with
2 teaspoons coconut oil.

Soak raisins in warm water in a small bowl until rehydrated, about 10 minutes;
drain. Chop raisins.

Beat 1/4 cup coconut oil, butter, and brown sugar together in a bowl. Add
eggs, mashed bananas, applesauce, and grated carrot; beat to incorporate.
Gently fold bread flour, whole-wheat flour, flax seed, chopped raisins, baking
soda, salt, and vanilla extract into the banana mixture using a rubber
spatula; pour into prepared muffin cups.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes
out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing
to cool completely on a wire rack.
