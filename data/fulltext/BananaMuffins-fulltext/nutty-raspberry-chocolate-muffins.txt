Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or fill
with paper liners.

Mix almond meal, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking
soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.

Beat butter and sugar together in a separate bowl until light and fluffy. Add
eggs, one by one, beating until each is incorporated. Stir vanilla into the
butter mixture.

Mix milk and yogurt together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture,
alternating with milk mixture, to the flour mixture until just incorporated.
Stir mashed banana into batter; fold in raspberries and chocolate chips. Fill
muffin cups 3/4-full with batter.

Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in
the middle of the muffins comes out clean, 18 to 25 minutes.
