Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with
paper muffin liners.

In a large bowl, stir together flour, 1/2 cup sugar, salt and 1 teaspoon
cinnamon. Stir in milk, banana, apples, orange zest and vanilla extract. Spoon
batter into prepared muffin cups.

Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Check bake
time by inserting a toothpick into the center of a muffin. The muffins are
done when the toothpick comes out clean.

While muffins bake, combine 1/4 cup white sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a
small saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Brush glaze
over baked muffins, then sprinkle muffins with as much cinnamon as you like.
