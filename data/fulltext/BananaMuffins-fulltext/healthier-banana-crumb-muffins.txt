Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 10 muffin cups
or line with muffin papers.

Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
Beat bananas, sugar, egg, and melted butter in another bowl. Stir banana
mixture into flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared
muffin cups.

Combine brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Blend
in 1 tablespoon butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle
topping over muffins.

Bake in preheated oven until golden and tops spring back when lightly pressed,
18 to 20 minutes.
