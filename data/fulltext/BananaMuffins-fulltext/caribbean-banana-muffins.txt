Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with
paper liners.

Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a bowl; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat
in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, then beat in the
bananas and rum extract. Stir in the flour mixture. Fold in the shredded
coconut and pineapple; mixing just enough to evenly distribute. Evenly divide
the batter among the prepared muffin cups.

Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
