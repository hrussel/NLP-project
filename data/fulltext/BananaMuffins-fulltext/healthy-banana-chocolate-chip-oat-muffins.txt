Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line
with paper liners.

Stir whole wheat flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and
chocolate chips together in a bowl. Make a well in the center. Whisk eggs in a
separate bowl until frothy; mix applesauce, skim milk, and banana into eggs.
Pour moist ingredients into well made in dry ingredients; stir just to
moisten. Batter will be lumpy. Fill prepared muffin cups about 3/4 full.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of
several muffins comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes. Cool in pan for 5 minutes
before removing to finish cooling on wire racks.
