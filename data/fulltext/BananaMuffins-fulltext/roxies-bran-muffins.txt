Steps

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or
line with paper cupcake liners.

Cover raisins with water in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on High for 1
minute to plump. Drain the raisins, and set aside.

Beat the egg with milk in a bowl, and mix in the bran cereal. Let the mixture
stand until the cereal absorbs the liquid, about 5 minutes. Gently mix in the
plumped raisins, flour, baking soda, cinnamon, melted butter, shredded apple,
mashed banana, and honey, and stir a few times to mix.

Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, and bake in the preheated oven
for about 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a
muffin comes out clean.
