poppy-seed-and-banana-muffins

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup muffin
pan.

In a large bowl, mix whole wheat flour, wheat bran, wheat germ, baking soda,
baking powder, and salt.

In a medium bowl, beat together eggs, honey, and vegetable oil. Stir in
bananas, milk, lemon juice, and poppy seeds.

Make a well in the center of the wheat flour mixture, and pour in egg and
banana mixture. Stir until just blended. Spoon into the prepared muffin pan.

Bake 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean.
