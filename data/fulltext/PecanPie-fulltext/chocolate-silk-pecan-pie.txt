Steps

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place pie crust in 9-inch glass pie plate as
directed on box for One-Crust Filled Pie.

In small bowl, beat eggs with electric mixer on medium speed until well
blended. Add granulated sugar, corn syrup, butter and salt; beat 1 minute.
Stir in pecans. Pour into crust-lined pie plate. Cover crust edge with 2- to 3
-inch-wide strips of foil to prevent excessive browning; remove foil during
last 15 minutes of bake time.

Bake 40 to 55 minutes or until center of pie is puffed and golden brown. Cool
1 hour.

Meanwhile, in blender or food processor, place chocolate filling ingredients.
Cover; blend about 1 minute or until smooth. Refrigerate until mixture is
slightly thickened but not set, about 1 hour 30 minutes.

Gently stir chocolate filling; pour over cooled pecan filling in crust.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm before serving.

Just before serving, in small bowl, beat whipping cream, powdered sugar and
1/4 teaspoon vanilla with mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Spoon or
pipe whipped cream over filling. Garnish with chocolate curls. Cover and
refrigerate any remaining pie.
