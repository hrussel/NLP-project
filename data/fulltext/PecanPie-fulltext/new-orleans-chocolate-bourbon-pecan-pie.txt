Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Beat the sugar, corn syrup, bourbon, eggs, butter, and salt together in a
mixing bowl until smooth and creamy. Fold in the pecans and chocolate chips.
Pour the mixture into the prepared pie crust. If desired, cover the edges of
the pie with aluminum foil strips to prevent excessive browning.

Bake in preheated oven until the center sets, about 50 minutes. Cool before
serving.
