Steps

In a medium bowl, mix together flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Using a pastry
blender or two knives, cut half of the shortening into flour mixture, until
fine crumbs form. Cut in remaining shortening until coarse crumbs form. Add
water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until a dough forms. Shape
dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap; chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

On a floured surface, using a floured rolling pin, roll dough into an 11-inch
circle. Fit dough into a 9-in quiche dish. Trim edges

In a heavy skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over low heat. Add nuts and stir
for about 5 minutes, or until nuts begin to color. Let cool for 10 minutes.

Mix together beaten egg, maple syrup, sugar, 1/3 cup melted butter, vanilla,
and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in nuts. Pour filling into crust. Bake for 45 to
50 minutes, or until filling is set. Transfer pan to wire rack and cool.
