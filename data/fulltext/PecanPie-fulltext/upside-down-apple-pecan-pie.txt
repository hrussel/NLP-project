Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

In a 9 inch deep-dish pie pan, combine pecans, brown sugar and margarine;
spread into a single layer. Roll out dough, and place bottom crust over pecan
mixture.

In a large bowl, combine apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. Pour into
crust in pan. Top with second crust. Fold edges of crust over, and flute to
seal edges. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.

Place pan on foil or cookie sheet during baking to guard against spillage.
Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until crust is golden brown
and apples are tender.

Cool pie in pan for 5 minutes. Place serving plate over pie, and flip to
invert, being careful not to come in contact with molten sugar. If some of the
nuts stick to the pan, remove them with a knife, and place on pie. Allow to
cool for 1 hour.
