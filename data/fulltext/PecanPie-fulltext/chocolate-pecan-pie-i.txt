Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) In a medium saucepan, melt the
butter over low heat. Stir in sugar, and set aside to cool.

In a mixing bowl, beat eggs well. Stir in salt, corn syrup and melted butter
mixture. Add coffee powder mixed with 1 teaspoon water, if desired. Stir in
the chopped pecans.

Spread chocolate chips evenly over the bottom of the pie crust. Pour pecan
mixture over the crust.

Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until set.
Cover and let stand at room temperature about 8 hours before serving. Pie will
be soft.

Combine cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla in a small mixing bowl. Whip
until stiff. Garnish pie.
