Steps

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

In a medium bowl, mix together the pecans, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter and
miniature chocolate chips. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch
pie plate. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool completely.

In a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water, combine 1 1/3 cups
chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butter. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth.
Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.

In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until thick and pale
using an electric mixer, at least 3 minutes. Stir into the melted chocolate
and set it back over the pan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until thick,
3 to 4 minutes. Pour into the cooled crust and smooth the top.

Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan. When warm, stir in the remaining
chocolate chips until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the brandy.
Pour over the truffle filling. Refrigerate for several hours to set before
serving.
