Steps

PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Position rack in the bottom
third of the oven.

MELT chocolate in the top of a double boiler over water that is barely
simmering. Stir constantly.

WHISK together sugar, corn syrup, eggs, chocolate, butter, vanilla and salt.
Add chopped pecans and pour into the unbaked pie shell. Arrange the pecan
halves artfully on top of the filling.

BAKE in preheated oven for 50-60 minutes. The center may still seem under-set.
Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cut into wedges and serve with a generous
dollop of whipped cream.
