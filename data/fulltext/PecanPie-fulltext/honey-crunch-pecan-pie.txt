Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

To Make Crust: In a medium bowl, mix together flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut
in shortening until mixture is crumbly. Gradually add water and vinegar. Cut
together until mixture will hold together. Press dough into a ball and flour
each side lightly. Wrap in plastic and chill for 20 minutes. Roll out between
wax paper into a circle 1/8 inch thick and press into 9 inch pie pan.

To Make Filling: In a large bowl, combine eggs, 1/4 cup brown sugar, white
sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla extract, and
chopped pecans. Add bourbon if desired. Mix well. Spoon mixture into unbaked
pie shell.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove and cover edges of pastry with
aluminum foil. Return to oven for 20 minutes.

To Make Topping: Combine 1/3 cup brown sugar, butter or margarine, and honey
in a medium saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar
dissolves - about 2 minutes. Add pecans. Stir just until coated. Spoon topping
evenly over pie.

Keep foil on edges of pastry and return pie to oven for an additional 10 to 20
minutes, until topping is bubbly and golden brown. Cool to room temperature
before serving.
