Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

To Make Crust: In a medium bowl combine flour and salt. Stir well, then cut in
butter until mixture is the size of small peas. Add ice water and mix just

Allow dough to rest in refrigerator for 20 minutes, then roll out and fit into
a 9-inch pie plate. Set aside.

To Make Filling: In a medium bowl mix eggs and sugar. Add corn syrup and
melted butter or margarine. Mix until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.

Spread chocolate chips and pecan pieces across bottom of pie shell. Pour egg
mixture over chocolate chip and pecan layer.

whipped cream and a sprinkling of chocolate chips if desired.
