Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Prick pastry shell in several places with a fork and bake in preheated oven
for 5 minutes. Remove and allow to cool.

In a large bowl, combine sugar, corn syrup, eggs, vanilla, salt, and pecans.
Mix well, then pour into pie shell.

Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Check after 30 minutes; if crust is
getting too brown, cover edges with aluminum foil. When done, pie will be a
little loose in center, but will set as it cools; do not overbake.

Ingredients

1 (9 inch) pie shell
