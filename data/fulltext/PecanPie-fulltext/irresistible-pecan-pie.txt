Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

To Make Crust: In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt and white sugar. Cut
butter into flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually sprinkle
the water over the dry mixture, stirring until dough comes together enough to
form a ball.

On a floured surface flatten dough ball with rolling pin. Roll out into a
circle that is one inch larger than pie dish. Place pie shell into dish and
refrigerate until pie filling is complete.

To Make Pie Filling: In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, light and dark corn
syrups, brown sugar, butter, salt and finely crushed pecans. Spread quartered
pecans over bottom of refrigerated pie crust. Pour syrup mixture over top of
pecans, then arrange pecan halves on top of pie.

Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for one hour or until
firm; let cool for one hour before serving.
