Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In medium mixing bowl beat eggs lightly with a rotary beater or fork. Stir in
corn syrup, sugar, and butter; mix well. Stir in pecan and chocolate pieces.

To prevent overbrowning, cover edges of pie shell with aluminum foil. Place
pie shell on oven rack and pour filling into it.

Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil from crust edges and bake
an additional 25 minutes, or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.
Chill before serving. May be served with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
