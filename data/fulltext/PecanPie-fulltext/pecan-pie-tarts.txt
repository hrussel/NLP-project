Steps

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

Grease 30 tart tins or muffin cups and set aside.

To Make Crust: In a medium mixing bowl cream together cream cheese and 1 cup
butter until light and fluffy. Blend in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, forming a
smooth dough. Roll into 30 equal balls and press one into each greased tin so
it lines the bottom and sides, like a pie crust.

To Make Filling: In a medium mixing bowl cream together 1/4 cup butter and
sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla until thoroughly
blended. Stir in pecans. Fill each lined tin half full. Mixture will rise as
it bakes.

Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let cool in
tins, then use the end of a table knife to flip each tart out of its tin.
