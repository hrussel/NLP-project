Steps

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Press pie crusts into two
9-inch pie pans.

Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water,
stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid
scorching.

Mix sugar, flour, and salt together in a bowl.

Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl; stir
buttermilk mixture into sugar mixture. Slowly pour melted chocolate into
mixture, while beating with an electric mixer, until filling is smooth. Pour
half the filling into each prepared pie crust. Sprinkle pecans over each pie.

Bake pies in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 1 hour. Cool for
at least 1 hour before serving.
