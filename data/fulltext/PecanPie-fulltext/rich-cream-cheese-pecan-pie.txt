Steps

In a small bowl, blend together cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/3
cup sugar, and salt. Mix by hand until mostly smooth. Spread mixture into the
bottom of the unbaked pie shell. Sprinkle with chopped pecans.

In another bowl, slightly beat 3 eggs. Stir in 1/4 cup sugar, corn syrup, and
1 teaspoon vanilla; blend well. Fold in chopped chocolate or chocolate chips.
Very CAREFULLY pour corn syrup mixture over pecans. Cover pie crust edge with
a strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.

Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until center is
set. Cool completely. Store in refrigerator.
