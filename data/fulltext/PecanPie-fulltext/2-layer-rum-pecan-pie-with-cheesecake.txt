Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Unroll 1 pie crust on a work surface; brush with water. Place second pie crust
atop the first pie crust; press gently together. Place the double crust in a
9-inch pie pan.

Beat cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, vanilla, and salt together in a bowl
until smooth and creamy. Pour into pie crust; sprinkle cheesecake filling with
pecans.

Mix corn syrup, butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 3 eggs, and rum extract together in a
bowl until smooth; pour over pecan layer.

Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the pie
comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
