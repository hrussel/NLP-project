Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Chop 4 bacon strips; set
remaining 4 bacon strips aside.

Cook chopped bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until
bacon is browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Set chopped bacon aside.

Lightly mix ground beef, bread crumbs, beaten egg, garlic, 1 teaspoon
Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until
thoroughly combined. Spread meat mixture out on a piece of waxed paper,
forming a rectangle about 10 inches square. Spread Cheddar cheese and cooked
chopped bacon over the meat, leaving a 1/2-inch edge all around. Carefully
lift an edge and roll the meat around the filling. Place into a loaf pan with
the seam side down.

Bake meat loaf in the preheated oven until hot and beginning to brown, about
30 minutes. Mix ketchup, brown sugar, pineapple, and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire
sauce together in a bowl, stirring to dissolve brown sugar. Remove meat loaf
from oven and place remaining 4 bacon strips onto meat loaf, weaving them
together. Spread pineapple mixture over woven bacon and top of loaf.

Return meat loaf to oven and bake until bacon topping is crisp and pineapple
mixture has baked into a glaze, about 20 more minutes. An instant-read meat
thermometer inserted into the center of the meat loaf should read 160 degrees
F (70 degrees C).
