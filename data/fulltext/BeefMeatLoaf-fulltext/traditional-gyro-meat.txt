Steps

Place the onion in a food processor, and process until finely chopped. Scoop
the onions onto the center of a towel, gather up the ends of the towel, and
squeeze out the liquid from the onions. Place the onions into a mixing bowl
along with the lamb and beef. Season with the garlic, oregano, cumin,
marjoram, rosemary, thyme, black pepper, and salt. Mix well with your hands
until well combined. Cover, and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to allow the flavors
to blend.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

Place the meat mixture into the food processor, and pulse for about a minute
until finely chopped and the mixture feels tacky. Pack the meat mixture into a
7x4 inch loaf pan, making sure there are no air pockets. Line a roasting pan
with a damp kitchen towel. Place the loaf pan on the towel, inside the
roasting pan, and place into the preheated oven. Fill the roasting pan with
boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the loaf pan.

Bake until the gyro meat is no longer pink in the center, and the internal
temperature registers 165 degrees F (75 degrees C) on a meat thermometer, 45
minutes to 1 hour. Pour off any accumulated fat, and allow to cool slightly
before slicing thinly and serving.
