Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch
baking dish with cooking spray.

Stir ground beef, onion, oats, Cheddar cheese, milk, egg, and salt together in
a bowl; mix well. Divide meat mixture into 8 equal portions and form each into
a loaf shape. Place loaves in prepared baking dish.

Stir ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard together in a bowl until smooth. Spread
ketchup mixture over meat loaves.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 40
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
