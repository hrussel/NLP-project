Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, saute the carrot and onion for 2
minutes, or until onion is transparent. Add garlic and saute for 2 more
minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.

In a large bowl, combine the parsley, beef, ketchup, 1/2 cup tomato sauce,
bread and eggs, mixing well. Add the carrot/onion mixture and continue mixing,
but do not over mix, as this will make the meatloaf dry. Transfer mixture to a
9x13 baking dish and form into a loaf.

Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes.

While loaf is baking, heat the remaining tomato sauce and sugar in a medium
saucepan over medium low heat. Pour over loaf when done.
