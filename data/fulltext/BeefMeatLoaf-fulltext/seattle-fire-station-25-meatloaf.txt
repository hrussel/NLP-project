Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions, and
cook, stirring frequently, until bacon is crisp and onions are transparent.
Drain off excess grease, and set aside to cool.

In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, pork sausage, bacon and onions,
spinach, olives, pistachio nuts, 1 cup of ketchup, eggs, and meatloaf
seasoning until well blended. Pat meat into a loaf shape, and place in a large
baking pan. A roasting pan will work well. Poke cheese cubes into the top of
the loaf so they are completely covered. Brush remaining ketchup generously
over the top.

Bake for 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, or until the internal temperature
of the loaf is 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
