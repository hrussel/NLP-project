Steps

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Combine ground beef, eggs and 2 tablespoons of ketchup in a large bowl. Mix
well, then add bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, oregano,
basil, pepper, and onion. Set mixture aside. Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch
pan with bacon, widthwise. Place half of the meat mixture across the top of
the bacon. Lay 3 of the 4 pieces of Cheddar cheese across the center of the
meat, lengthwise. Cover the cheese with the second half of the meat mixture
and mold the meat into a loaf shape. Pull the ends of the bacon up and around
the loaf. Spread 1 tablespoon of ketchup thinly over the loaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 60
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove from the oven.

Cut the final piece of Cheddar cheese into slices and place on top of the meat
loaf. Return the meat loaf to the oven and continue baking until the cheese is
melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the meat loaf to rest
for 5 minutes before serving.
