Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 9x13-inch baking
pan.

Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; saute onion and garlic until onion
is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add green bell pepper to onion mixture and
saute until bell pepper is softened, about 3 more minutes.

Mix sirloin, bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl
with your hands; add vegetable mixture and loosely mix. Mix egg into sirloin
mixture; add oats if mixture is too wet. Transfer sirloin mixture to the
prepared baking pan and form into a loaf.

Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Whisk ketchup, sugar, honey, and
hot sauce together in a bowl; brush over meat loaf. Continue baking until no
longer pink in the center, about 40 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
