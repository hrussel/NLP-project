Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.

In a large bowl, mix together ground beef, salsa, cheese, egg, and cracker
crumbs. Form into a loaf, and place in prepared pan.

Bake for approximately 1 hour, or until done. Internal temperature should
measure at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), the meat should be browned
through, and the juices clear.
