Steps

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the cooking
sauce, the beef, bread crumbs, egg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper
until well mixed.

Spray 12 regular-size muffin cups with cooking spray. Divide beef mixture
evenly among cups (slightly less than 1/4 cup each). Push 1 piece of cheese
into center of each.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until thermometer inserted in center of loaves in
middle of muffin pan reads 160 degrees F. Meanwhile, heat remaining sauce
until hot. Immediately remove loaves from muffin pan; spoon heated sauce over
loaves. Serve with potatoes.
