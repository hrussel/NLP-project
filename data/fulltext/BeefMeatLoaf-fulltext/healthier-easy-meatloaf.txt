Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf
pan.

Combine beef, egg, onion, milk, bread crumbs, parsley, and carrot in a large
bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Place beef mixture in loaf pan.

Stir together brown sugar, mustard, and ketchup in a small bowl. Pour over
meatloaf.

Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An
instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160
degrees F (70 degrees C).
