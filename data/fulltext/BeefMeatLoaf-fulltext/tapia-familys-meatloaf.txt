Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix ground beef, Mexican-style tomato sauce, eggs, onion soup mix, bread
crumbs, green chiles, garlic and herb seasoning, and garlic powder in a large
bowl until thoroughly combined. Place mixture into a large loaf pan and shape
into a loaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until meatloaf is no longer pink inside and an
instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the middle of the loaf shows at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour.
