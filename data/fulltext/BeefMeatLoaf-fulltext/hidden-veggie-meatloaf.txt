Steps

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

Combine ground beef, ground turkey, egg, celery, rolled oats, skim milk,
ketchup, onion, green pepper, parsley, dry mustard, salt, minced garlic, and
black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined; mixture will be moist.
Transfer mixture into a 5x9-inch loaf pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted
into the center of the meatloaf reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C),
about 1 1/2 hours. Meatloaf may still look pink inside due to ketchup.
