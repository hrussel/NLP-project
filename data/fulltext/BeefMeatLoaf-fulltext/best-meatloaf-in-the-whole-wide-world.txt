Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir ketchup, brown sugar,
bacon bits, pineapple, and 1 dash Worcestershire sauce together in a small
bowl; reserve.

Combine the ground beef, bread crumbs, saltines, egg, garlic, onion, and 2
dashes of Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl; mix well. Pat meat mixture
into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.

Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven; pour
reserved pineapple mixture over loaf. Return to the oven; bake until no longer
pink in the center, about an additional 20 minutes. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70
degrees C).
