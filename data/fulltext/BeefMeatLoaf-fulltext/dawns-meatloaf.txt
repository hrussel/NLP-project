Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix ground beef, egg, oats, onion, milk, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt,
and pepper together in a bowl; transfer into a loaf pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 50 to 60
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
