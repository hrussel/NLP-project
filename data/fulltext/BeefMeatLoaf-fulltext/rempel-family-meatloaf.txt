Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Stir the ground beef, crushed crackers, Cheddar cheese, and onion soup mix in
a large bowl until well combined. Whisk the eggs, ketchup, and steak sauce in
a separate bowl until smooth. Mix the eggs into the meat until evenly
combined, if the mixture seems too dry, add a little water. Press into a 9x5
inch loaf pan.

Bake in preheated oven until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C)
and is no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes.
