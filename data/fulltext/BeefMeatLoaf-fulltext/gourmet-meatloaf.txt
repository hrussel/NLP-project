Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, bread crumbs, egg and steak
sauce. Mix thoroughly. Blend in soup mix, green pepper, onion, cilantro and
garlic.

On a large piece of aluminum foil, pat the beef mixture into a thin, flat
rectangle. Layer about 1/2 the ham on top of the beef from end to end. Layer
ham with the Cheddar cheese. Layer cheese with remaining ham, then the
broccoli.

Using the foil, roll the meatloaf while pinching the ends. Keep aluminum foil
around the meat loaf and place on a medium baking sheet.

Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
