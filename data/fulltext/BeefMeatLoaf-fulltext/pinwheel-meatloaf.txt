Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Make the filling: Coarsely chop the spinach, and place in a large bowl; set
aside. Heat butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute mushrooms
and onion until onion is translucent. Transfer mushroom mixture to bowl with
spinach. Mix in 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1 egg and parsley. Season with salt,
pepper and nutmeg.

In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, Cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup
bread crumbs, 1 egg. Season with Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Place
meat mixture between two sheets of waxed paper, and roll into a rectangle
approximately 18x8 inches. Remove top sheet. Spread spinach mixture evenly
over meat, leaving a 1/2 inch border. Roll up meat from the short end in
jelly-roll style, lifting and removing paper as you go. Place loaf into an 8x4
inch loaf pan.

Bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until browned and juices run
clear. Serve hot or cold.
