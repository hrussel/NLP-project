Steps

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Beat the egg in a mixing bowl, then add the ground beef, tomatoes, and crushed
crackers. Season with onion flakes, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper.
Mix until evenly combined. Pack into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160
degrees F (70 degrees C).
