the-creeks-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix ground sirloin, bacon, onion, bell pepper, oats, Cheddar cheese, sour
cream, Worcestershire sauce, and Cajun seasoning salt in a large bowl; shape
into a loaf.

Line 1 1/2-quart loaf pan with bread slices. Put loaf atop the bread.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 15
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Stir tomato sauce and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat;
simmer until the sugar dissolves. Add Cheddar cheese in small batches,
stirring to melt each batch before adding the next. Stir onion and parsley
into the sauce and continue cooking until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce
over the meatloaf.
