Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Place spinach in a microwave safe bowl with a splash of water. Cover, and
microwave until the spinach has wilted, about 5 minutes. Drain and allow to
cool.

In a large bowl, mix together beef, pork, eggs, bread crumbs, and Romano
cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Divide into two equal portions, and roll
each into balls.

Place a 15-inch long piece of plastic wrap on your work surface and lightly
sprinkle with flour. Place one of the balls onto the plastic wrap and pat into
a thin, 8-inch by 10-inch rectangle. Cover evenly with half of the spinach and
3 slices of prosciutto, then shingle three slices of provolone running along
the edge facing you.

Using the plastic wrap to lift the meat, roll the loaf starting from the
cheese side into a firmly packed spiral, peeling away the plastic wrap as you
go. Make a second loaf with remaining ingredients.

To bake, pour wine into a broiler pan bottom. Oil the slotted top with some of
the olive oil before placing the loaves on and brushing them with remaining
oil. Cover loaves with a sheet of aluminum foil and bake in preheated oven for
40 minutes.

Remove the foil and pour water into the pan. Continue baking for another 35
minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).
Allow to rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1-inch thick slices to serve.
