Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking
dish.

Mix the ground beef and ground pork in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix
the corn, cornbread, sour cream, pepperjack cheese, onion, milk, egg, jalapeno
peppers, garlic, kosher salt, and pepper. Gently mix the corn mixture into the
meat mixture. Form into a rounded loaf shape, and place in the prepared baking
dish

Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 160
degrees F (72 degrees C). Loosely cover with aluminum foil during the last 15
minutes of cook time if the loaf is overly brown.
