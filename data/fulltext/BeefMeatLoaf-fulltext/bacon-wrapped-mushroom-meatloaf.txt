Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Thoroughly mix beef, pork, lamb, mushrooms, bread crumbs, eggs, garlic, thyme,
soy sauce, soup base, parsley, and sage in a large bowl; shape into 2 loaves.
Wrap bacon strips around the loaves to cover completely. Place loaves on a
baking sheet.

Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are no longer pink in the center,
90 minutes to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
