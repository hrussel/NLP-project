skillet-meatloaf

Steps

In a large bowl, mix together 1/4 cup of the tomato soup, ground beef, bread
crumbs, egg, onion, salt and pepper using your hands. Shape firmly into two
loaves.

Heat a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the meatloaves in the
hot skillet, then reduce heat to medium and cover with a lid. Simmer for about
25 minutes, or until meat is cooked through.

Spoon the fat from the skillet, and stir in the remaining soup, water, and
mustard. Top with mozzarella cheese, and let simmer uncovered for 10 minutes,
stirring sauce occasionally.
