Steps

Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
broiler. Arrange peppers on a baking sheet.

Broil peppers in the preheated oven until bubbling and skin becomes blackened,
5 to 10 minutes per side. Remove from oven and transfer peppers to a bowl of
ice water; set aside for skin to loosen from peppers, about 10 minutes. Remove
peppers from water and peel blackened skin from peppers and remove seeds.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with
cooking spray.

Place peppers and dates in a food processor; pulse until evenly combined.

Mix pepper-date mixture, ground beef, goat cheese, 1/4 cup barbeque sauce,
bread crumbs and egg together in a bowl or in a stand-mixer until evenly
combined. Pour beef mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Spread 2 tablespoons
barbeque sauce evenly over meat mixture.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160
degrees F (70 degrees C).
