Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For the glaze, combine the 1/3 cup ketchup,
brown sugar, and the 2 teaspoons mustard in a small bowl. Set aside until
ready to use.

Combine eggs, milk, the 1/3 cup ketchup, and the 1 teaspoon mustard in a large
bowl. Stir in ground beef, rolled oats, onion, salt, and pepper; mix well.
Gently press mixture in an ungreased 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Bake for 30 minutes.
Drain off fat.

[Cleaning tip: Wipe off any grease or spills on the countertop with CloroxÂ®
Disinfecting Wipes*.]

After 30 minutes of baking, spoon the glaze evenly over the meatloaf. Bake for
30 to 45 minutes more or until a thermometer registers 160 degrees F. Let the
meat loaf stand for 15 minutes. Drain off fat. Carefully slice meatloaf and
use a spatula to transfer to a serving platter.
