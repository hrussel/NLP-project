Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.

Mix eggs, spinach, mushrooms, bread crumbs, onion, milk, blue cheese,
Worcestershire sauce, garlic, cayenne pepper, oregano, basil, salt, and black
pepper together in a large bowl. Add ground beef and mix thoroughly with your
hands; pack into prepared loaf pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
