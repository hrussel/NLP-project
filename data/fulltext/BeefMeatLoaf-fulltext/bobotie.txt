Steps

Heat water in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and add the onion
slices. Reduce heat and simmer until the onions appear translucent, 3 to five
minutes. Remove the onions and finely chop them.

Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook
and stir until the onion has browned slightly.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch baking dish.

Soak the slice of bread in the milk and gently squeeze out the milk; set the
milk aside. Crumb the bread into a large mixing bowl. Mix bread together with
ground beef, curry powder, 1 egg, sugar, salt, black pepper, turmeric,
vinegar, chutney, almonds and raisins.

Place the mixture the prepared baking dish. Insert the bay leaves into the
meat. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.

Beat the remaining egg with 3 tablespoons of the drained milk. Pour over the
meat and bake for another 30 minutes.
