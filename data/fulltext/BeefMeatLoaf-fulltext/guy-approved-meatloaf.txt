Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

In a large bowl, combine the beef, eggs, onion, barbecue sauce, cracker
crumbs, potato chips, liquid smoke, ground black pepper, salt, garlic powder
and cayenne pepper and mix well.

On a lightly greased cookie sheet, shape the mixture into a loaf. Lay the
bacon slices across the width of the loaf so that the entire surface is
covered. Cover the loaf loosely with foil.

Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 1/2 hours.
