Steps

Put tomatoes in a bowl. Pour hot water over tomatoes and soak until softened,
about 30 minutes; drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a loaf pan with cooking
spray.

Mix drained tomatoes, ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, basil, ketchup,
provolone cheese, egg whites, and garlic together in a bowl; pack into
prepared loaf pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160
degrees F (70 degrees C).
