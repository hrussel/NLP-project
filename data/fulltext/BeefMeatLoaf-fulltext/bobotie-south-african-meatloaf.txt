Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish.

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted
butter until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.

Combine 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, oats, raisins, almonds, vinegar, curry powder,
sugar, salt, turmeric, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add onions and ground
beef; mix well. Spread the beef evenly into the prepared baking dish; top with
bay leaves.

Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and drain excess fat
from the beef.

Beat 1 egg and 1/4 cup milk together in a bowl; pour over the beef mixture.

Continue baking in oven until the top is beginning to brown, about 30 minute
more. Remove and discard bay leaves to serve.
