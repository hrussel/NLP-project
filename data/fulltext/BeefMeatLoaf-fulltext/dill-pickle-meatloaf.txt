dill-pickle-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8x8 inch baking
dish.

Beat the egg in a mixing bowl. Whisk in the onion, pickle juice, salt, and
pepper. Stir in the bread until soggy, then mix in the ground beef until
evenly combined. Form into a loaf and place into the prepared pan. Stir
together the chopped pickles, ketchup, water, sugar, and Worcestershire sauce;
pour over the meatloaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160
degrees F (70 degrees C).
