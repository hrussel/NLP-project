lemon-barbeque-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking
dish or a dish of similar size.

In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, lemon juice, water, egg, bread,
onion and seasoning salt until well blended. Shape into 6 individual loaves -
I like to make large balls. Place them in the prepared baking dish.

Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven while you prepare the topping. In a
small bowl, stir together the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard powder, allspice
and cloves. Spoon the sauce over the loaves, then top each one with a slice of
lemon. Return to the oven, and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until
cooked through.
