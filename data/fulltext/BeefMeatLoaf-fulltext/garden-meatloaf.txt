garden-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.

Lightly mix the ground chuck, onion, brown sugar, egg, salsa, and bread crumbs
in a bowl, and spoon into the prepared baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until the meatloaf is cooked
all the way through and the top is browned. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Ingredients

1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck

1/2 cup chopped onion

1/2 cup brown sugar

1 beaten egg

1 (15 ounce) jar chunky salsa

1 1/2 cups dry bread crumbs
