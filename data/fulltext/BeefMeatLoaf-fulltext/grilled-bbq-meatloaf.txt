Steps

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and scrape the grates clean. Spray
grates with nonstick cooking spray.

In a bowl, mix together the ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, onion,
egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, tarragon, sea salt, and black pepper.
Divide the mixture in half, and form 2 loaves, each about 4 inches in diameter
and 6 inches long. In a small bowl, mix the barbecue sauce with ketchup until
well combined.

Place each meatloaf directly on the prepared grill grates, then spread each
with about 3 tablespoons of barbecue sauce mixture; grill until the loaves
reach an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees F (73 degrees C), about
1 hour.
