Steps

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to
boiling. In large bowl combine egg, 1/2 cup of the Classico® Tomato and Basil
pasta sauce, bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons of the basil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Add beef and 1/2 cup of the cheese; mix well. Divide beef mixture in four
equal portions. Shape each portion in a 5-1/2x2-inch oval. Place on
15x10x1-inch baking pan. Spoon on remaining Classico® Tomato and Basil pasta
sauce and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 15 minutes or until internal
temperature registers 160 degrees F.

Meanwhile, cook green beans in boiling salted water for 10 minutes. Drain;
toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper. Serve with meat loaves.
Sprinkle all with remaining basil leaves.
