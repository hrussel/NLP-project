Steps

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large muffin pan
with cooking spray.

Combine ground beef, blue cheese, onion, bread crumbs, spinach, eggs, and
Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl until well blended. Divide meat mixture
evenly into the prepared muffin pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
