Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with
nonstick cooking spray.

In food processor or blender, pulse stuffing mix to fine crumbs; place in
large bowl. Stir in ground beef, ground pork, onion, green pepper, tomatoes,
eggs, seasoned salt, seasoning blend, and pepper. Use your hands to mix very
well; pat into prepared pan.

Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 minutes to 1
hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.
