Steps

In a small bowl, mix together the tomato sauce, brown sugar, and mustard; stir
until the brown sugar has dissolved.

In a large mixing bowl, mix the eggs, minced onion and green pepper, garlic
powder, cracker crumbs, salt, and black pepper; mix in the ground beef and
half the tomato sauce mixture, stirring until the meat loaf is thoroughly
combined. Place the meat mixture into a 2-quart microwave-safe baking dish.
Spread the remaining tomato sauce mixture over the meat loaf.

Cook in microwave oven on High setting until set, the juices run clear, and
meat is no longer pink inside, 10 to 15 minutes depending on power of
microwave oven. An instant-read meat thermometer, inserted into the center of
the loaf, should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Drain any grease from the
dish as soon as loaf is cooked; allow to stand, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes
before serving.
