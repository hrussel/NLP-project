sloppy-joe-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with
aluminum foil.

In a bowl, mix together the onion, celery, tomato paste, sloppy joe mix, bread
crumbs, and egg. Work in the ground beef lightly with your fingers until
thoroughly combined. Shape the mixture into a loaf shape, and place on the
prepared baking sheet. Lay bacon strips across the loaf crosswise, overlapping
if necessary.

Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then decrease temperature to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake until the meat loaf is no longer pink inside
and the juices run clear, about 30 more minutes. Use a bulb baster to remove
accumulating grease several times during baking. Allow to stand for 10 minutes
before slicing.
