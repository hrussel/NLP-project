Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a mixing bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, eggs, Worcestershire
sauce, onion, and parmesan cheese. Shape into a loaf and place in a 8x4-inch
loaf pan. Top with tomato sauce.

Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until internal temperature measures 160
degrees F (70 degrees C); the meat should be well done, with no trace of pink.
Remove from oven, and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
