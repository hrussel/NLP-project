Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch
baking dish.

Mix the ground beef, ground turkey, zucchini, onions, green bell pepper, egg,
Worcestershire sauce, Cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, and ranch dressing mix
until well combined. Form the mixture into a loaf in the middle of the
prepared baking dish.

Stir together the ketchup and steak sauce in a small bowl. Pour the sauce over
the top of the meatloaf. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in
the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
