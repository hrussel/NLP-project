Steps

Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the garlic,
onion, and celery in the hot butter until the onion has softened and turned
translucent, about 10 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a mixing bowl, and
allow to cool to just warm.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a sheet of aluminum
foil onto a baking sheet, and spray with nonstick cooking spray.

Crack the eggs into the mixing bowl with the vegetables, and mix until the egg
is smooth. Add the ground beef, Cajun seasoning, and bread crumbs. Mix with
your hands until the mixture is evenly blended. Form the meat mixture into the
shape of a stick man.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 35
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Once done, place the olive halves onto the
head for eyes, and pour the ketchup onto the abdomen. Return to oven, and bake
10 more minutes. Serve with a plastic knife impaled in the abdomen for effect.
