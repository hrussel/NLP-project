Steps

Fold each sheet of aluminum foil in half lengthwise, then fold in half
lengthwise again, to make 2 strips of foil 4 inches wide by 16 inches long.
Place the strips into the bottom of a slow cooker in a cross, so that the long
ends of the strips come partway up the inside of the cooker (to make lifting
handles). Spray the inside of the slow cooker and the foil strips with cooking
spray.

Mix together the ground beef, pork sausage, egg whites, grits, onion powder,
garlic powder, ketchup, and liquid smoke flavoring until thoroughly combined,
and form into a rounded loaf. Gently place the loaf into the slow cooker on
top of the crossed foil strips.

Cover the cooker, set on Low, and cook for 5 to 6 hours. To serve, carefully
hold the ends of the foil strips, and gently lift the meat loaf from the
cooker by the foil handles to place on a serving platter for slicing.
