halloween-halfling-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix together the ground beef, sausage, onion, saltine cracker crumbs, beaten
eggs, and cajun seasoning in a bowl until well combined. In a large baking
dish, form the meat loaf mixture into a Halfling shape, with a large head, 2
stubby legs, and 2 upraised arms.

Bake in the preheated oven until the meatloaf is no longer pink inside and
just starting to turn brown, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (70 degrees C).

To decorate the meatloaf's head, pick out about 14 corn kernels, and arrange
them into teeth. Place 1 small green pepper slice on each side of the
creature's head for ears; place two pickle slices on the face for eyes, then
place 2 black olive halves, cut sides down, in the pickle slices to finish the
eyes. One more olive half forms the nose. Surround the monster with a
background of ketchup "blood," and bake until browned, about 10 more minutes.

Let the meatloaf rest for 10 minutes before serving. Just before serving,
stick a paring knife in the meatloaf's body, and decorate it with a little
ketchup blood.
