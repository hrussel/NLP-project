Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Combine beef, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, eggs, Worcestershire sauce,
garlic, and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Season with salt and black
pepper. Transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
