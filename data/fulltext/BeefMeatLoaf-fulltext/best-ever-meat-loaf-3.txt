Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and ground black pepper in a large bowl. Add crumbled
bread and stir until dissolved. Mix ground beef, onion, Cheddar cheese, and
carrot into bread mixture; transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Combine
brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard in a small bowl; spread over meat mixture.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 1 to 1 1/4
hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
