contadina-mini-meatloaves-with-tomato-glaze

Steps

Combine beef, onion, cracker crumbs, Worcestershire and egg in a large bowl.
Mix well with hands or a spoon.

Shape meat into 6 rectangular mini meatloaves, each about the size of a deck
of cards (3-1/2 by 2x1/2 by 1/2-inch thick).

Heat oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat; brown meatloaves 3 to 4
minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside. Drain fat from pan.

Add sauce and brown sugar to pan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer over
medium heat 3 minutes, stirring frequently until slightly reduced. Return
meatloaves to pan and spoon sauce over tops. Simmer, uncovered, over medium
heat 5 minutes or until cooked through. Serve meatloaves and sauce with mashed
or roasted potatoes, if desired.
