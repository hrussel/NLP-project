christines-meat-loaf

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix ground beef, ground turkey, Italian sausage, vegetable soup, eggs, bread
crumbs, barbeque sauce, ketchup, yellow mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce,
browning sauce, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly
combined. Form into a loaf and place meat loaf into a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until meat loaf is browned and no longer pink
inside, 60 to 75 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the
thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Let meat loaf rest for 10 minutes before cutting into 1/2-inch thick slices.
