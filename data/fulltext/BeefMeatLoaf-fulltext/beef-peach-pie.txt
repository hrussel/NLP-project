Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, milk, onion, bread
crumbs, salt and pepper. Press into a 9 inch pie pan like a crust. Prick meat
all over using a fork.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven, and
pour off any excess fat. Arrange the sliced peaches over the beef. Mix
together the vinegar, ketchup and brown sugar, and spoon over the top of the
peaches.

Bake for an additional 20 minutes. Let stand for at least 10 minutes before
serving.
