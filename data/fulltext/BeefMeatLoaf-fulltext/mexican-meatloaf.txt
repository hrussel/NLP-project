Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a medium bowl, mix thoroughly the ground beef and taco seasoning; set
aside. In a medium saucepan, heat the refried beans over medium low heat until
they are completely heated through.

Place the ground beef mixture on a large piece of foil. Press the mixture into
an approximately 1 inch thick square shape. Spread the refried beans evenly
over the top of the flattened beef. Layer the flour tortillas on top of the
refried beans, trimming the edges to fit the square. Layer tortillas with
salsa and Cheddar cheese, staying 1/2 to 1 inch away from edges of the square.

Gently roll the layered beef into a Swiss roll shape, pressing and compacting
the loaf as you go. Pinch and seal the edges. Wrap in the foil and seal.

Bake in preheated oven 40 to 45 minutes, or until no longer pink in the
center. Cut loaf in half to test for doneness, if necessary.
