cheesy-apple-and-oat-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.

Mix the beef, pork, egg, apple, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper
in a mixing bowl until evenly mixed. Add the Cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, and
oats; mix again until evenly mixed. Pack the meat mixture into the prepared
loaf pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160
degrees F (72 degrees C). Allow the meatloaf to rest for 10 minutes before
slicing to keep the meat from crumbling.
