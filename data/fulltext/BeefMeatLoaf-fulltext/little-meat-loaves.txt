Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large bowl, combine the eggs, cracker crumbs, milk, cheese, onion,
Worcestershire sauce, Italian-style seasoning, garlic salt, ground beef and
ground sausage. Mix this together well and form into individual loaves. Place
the loaves in a 9x13 inch baking dish.

In a separate small bowl, combine the ketchup, brown sugar and Worcestershire
sauce. Mix this together well and spoon some of this sauce over each loaf.
Garnish each loaf with some Parmesan cheese and seasoning to taste.
