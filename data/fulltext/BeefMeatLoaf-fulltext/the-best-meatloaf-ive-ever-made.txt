Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic 5
minutes, until onion is tender. Remove from heat, and season with salt and
pepper.

In a large bowl, mix the onion and garlic, beef, crumbled bread, crushed
crackers, egg, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce.
Gradually stir in the milk 1 teaspoon at a time until mixture is moist, but
not soggy. Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.

Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to
400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal
temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

In a small bowl, mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup. Pour over the top
of the meatloaf, and continue baking 10 minutes.
