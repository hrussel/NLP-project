Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.

Mix ground beef with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a
bowl; form mixture into a loaf and place into prepared baking dish.

Bring root beer, raisins, Worcestershire sauce, and ketchup to a boil in a
saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended and raisins are
plump, about 5 minutes. Pour raisin sauce over meat loaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until meat loaf is no longer pink inside and an
instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads at
least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 25 to 30 minutes.
