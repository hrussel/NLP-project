dish.

Combine ground beef, rolled oats, French onion soup, and eggs in a bowl until
thoroughly combined; transfer to prepared baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until the meat loaf is no longer pink in the middle
and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf
reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 60 to 75 minutes.
