Steps

To make tomato sauce, heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook
and stir the onion, green pepper, and celery in the hot oil until the onion is
soft, about 5 minutes. Pour the undrained whole tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 1/2
teaspoons Italian seasoning, sugar, oregano, 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder,
Worcestershire sauce, and water into a blender and blend until smooth. Pour
the tomato mixture into the saucepan and simmer over low heat for 1 1/2 hours,
stirring occasionally. Stir in 1/4 cup parsley. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

In a bowl, mix together the ground beef, bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon garlic
powder, Creole seasoning, cayenne pepper, and salt until the mixture is
thoroughly combined; spread into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.

Scatter the mozzarella cheese over the meat; spread 1/4 cup of the sauce over
the cheese. Sprinkle the sauce with 1/4 cup chopped parsley and 2 teaspoons of
Italian seasoning. Pick up one end of the meat layer (short side), and gently
roll the meat around the filling. Reposition the meat roll in the center of
the dish, and pour the remaining tomato sauce over the roll.

Bake in the preheated oven until the roll is no longer pink in the center, 45
minutes to 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
