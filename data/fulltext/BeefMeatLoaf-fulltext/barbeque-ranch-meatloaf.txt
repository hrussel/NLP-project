barbeque-ranch-meatloaf

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix sausage and ground sirloin in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; add
eggs, bread crumbs, onion, and ranch dressing; mix well. Form into a loaf and
place into the center of a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Arrange fingerling potatoes and baby carrots around meatloaf and cover dish
with foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; remove foil and brush meatloaf with
barbeque sauce. Bake uncovered until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted
into the center of the loaf reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about
30 more minutes. Let meatloaf rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.
