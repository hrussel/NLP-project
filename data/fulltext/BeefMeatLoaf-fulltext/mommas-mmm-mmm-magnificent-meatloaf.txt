Steps

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Mix the ground beef, sausage, mushrooms, onion, barbecue sauce, Worcestershire
sauce, egg, oatmeal, garlic powder, pepper, and Cheddar cheese together in a
large bowl until evenly mixed. Form into a loaf and place in a 9x13-inch
baking dish. Lie the bacon strips across the top of the meatloaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160
degrees F (70 degrees C).
