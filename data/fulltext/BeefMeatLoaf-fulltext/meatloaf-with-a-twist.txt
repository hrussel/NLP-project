meatloaf-with-a-twist

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Mash the potatoes with a potato masher, and set aside.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and
garlic until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Set the onion and
garlic aside.

In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, salt, black
pepper, onion and garlic mixture, eggs, chicken broth, and Romano cheese until
thoroughly combined. In a second bowl, mix the mashed potatoes and ricotta
cheese.

Spoon half the meat mixture into the prepared baking dish, and smooth into an
even layer with a spoon. Spread the mashed potato mixture over the meat,
leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the meat; sprinkle 1 cup
mozzarella cheese over the mashed potato layer. Cover the cheese with the
remaining meat mixture in an even layer; press the edges down to seal in the
mashed potatoes. Sprinkle loaf with additional 2 tablespoons of mozzarella
cheese, if desired.

Bake in the preheated oven until the loaf is browned and the meat is no longer
pink, about 1 hour. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center
of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let the loaf
stand for 10 minutes before serving.
