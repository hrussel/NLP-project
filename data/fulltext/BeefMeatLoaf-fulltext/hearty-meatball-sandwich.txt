Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, salt and
pepper, garlic powder, and half of the mozzarella cheese. Form the mixture
into a log, and place it into an 8x8 inch baking dish.

Bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the center is no longer
pink. Let stand for 5 minutes, then slice into 1/2 inch slices. Place a few
slices onto each hoagie roll, cover with marinara sauce, and sprinkle
remaining mozzarella cheese over.

Wrap each sandwich with aluminum foil, and return to the oven for 15 minutes,
until bread is lightly toasted and cheese is melted. Let stand 15 minutes
before eating. Each sandwich serves 2.
