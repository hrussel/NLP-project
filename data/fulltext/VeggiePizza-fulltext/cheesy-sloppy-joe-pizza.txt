Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease 12-inch pizza pan. Unroll dough; place in

12 minutes or until crust begins to brown.

Meanwhile, cook beef in 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, until brown; drain. Stir in sloppy joe sauce. Spoon beef mixture

Bake an additional 10 to 12 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is
golden brown. Top with tomatoes and onions.
