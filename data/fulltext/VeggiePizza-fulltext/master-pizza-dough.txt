Steps

In a large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, and salt. Stir very
warm water and olive oil into flour mixture. Stir in enough remaining flour to
make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic,
about 4 to 6 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.

Lightly oil 1 (14-inch) or 2 (12-inch) round pizza pan(s).** Sprinkle with
cornmeal. Shape dough into smooth ball. Divide and roll dough to fit desired
pan(s). Top pizza as desired.

Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 to 30 minutes or until done. Baking time depends
on size and thickness of crust and selected toppings.
