Steps

Combine pesto and lemon juice in small bowl. Evenly brush beef steak with 1
tablespoon pesto mixture.

Place steaks on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, covered, 11 to 15
minutes (over medium heat on preheated gas grill, 13 to 16 minutes) for medium
rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning occasionally.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Spray 10x15-inch rimmed baking sheet
with cooking spray. Place dough on baking sheet and pat dough to edges of
baking sheet. Spread dough with remaining 3 tablespoons pesto mixture. Top
with tomatoes and cheese. Bake in 425 degrees F oven, 15 to 18 minutes or
until crust is golden brown.

Carve steak into slices; season with salt, if desired. Top pizza evenly with
arugula and steak slices; sprinkle with red pepper, as desired.
