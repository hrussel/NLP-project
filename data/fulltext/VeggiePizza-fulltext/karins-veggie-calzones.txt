Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.

Divide pizza dough into 4 equal parts. Roll each piece into a large oval on a
lightly floured surface.

Mix spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, cabbage, green bell pepper, fresh tomato,
onion, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, olives, garlic, and Italian
seasoning in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Divide vegetable
mixture over the center of each piece of dough, leaving about a 1-inch border
of dough. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese and about 2 tablespoons
Asiago cheese over vegetables

Fold pizza dough in half to create a half-moon; pinch and seal the edges of
each calzone. Transfer calzones to the prepared baking sheet. Cut small holes
on the top of each to vent; brush tops with olive oil.

Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle
remaining mozzarella cheese and Asiago cheese evenly over each calzone and
continue baking until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 5 to 10
minutes more. Serve with marinara sauce for dipping.
