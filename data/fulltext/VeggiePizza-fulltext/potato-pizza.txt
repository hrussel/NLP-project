Bake for 15 minutes. Spray top of shell with cooking oil and bake for 10 more
minutes. Place under broil and broil for 3 minutes, until golden and crisp.

In a large bowl combine the zucchini, yellow squash, green pepper, thinly
sliced onion, garlic and tofu. Toss to combine.

In a large nonstick skillet, saute vegetable/tofu mixture until vegetables are
just tender crisp.

Combine the tomato sauce and basil. Spread half of the sauce over the top to
the potato crust. Top with the sauteed vegetables and sliced tomatoes. Pour
