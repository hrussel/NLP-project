Steps

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.

Place the mushrooms, zucchini, squash, broccoli, and onion in a grill pan, and
brush with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cook on preheated, covered grill until
tender when pierced with a fork, about 5 minutes. Remove from grill and set
aside.

Roll out pizza dough on a floured surface to make two 8 inch circles 1/4 inch
thick. Place onto pizza pans. Brush tops with remaining 1 tablespoon olive
oil.

Bake on preheated, covered grill until browned, turning once, about 3 minutes
each side. Remove from grill and spread with pesto. Top with cooked
vegetables. Sprinkle with blue and fontina cheeses. Return to grill, cover,
and cook until cheese melts, about 3 minutes.
