Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). If using a pizza stone, place
in oven to preheat.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet; cook and stir onion and garlic
until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and continue to cook and stir until
all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and season with
basil, lemon juice, oregano, and pepper. Allow mixture to cool slightly.

Unroll pizza dough on preheated pizza stone or a large baking sheet and brush
with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Spread spinach mixture over dough,
leaving a small border at the edge of the pizza crust. Top with 1 cup
mozzarella cheese.

Press tomato slices into seasoned bread crumbs until coated; arrange tomatoes
over pizza. Spread remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese and feta cheese over
tomatoes.

Bake in preheated oven until pizza crust is golden brown and cheese is melted,
about 15 minutes.
