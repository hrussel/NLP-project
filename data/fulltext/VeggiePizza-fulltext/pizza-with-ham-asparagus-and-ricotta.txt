Steps

Preheat an oven to 550 degrees F (285 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook
uncovered until just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander, then
immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes. Once asparagus is cold,
drain well and set aside.

Combine ricotta, olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and
heavy cream in a small bowl. Stir in fresh herbs (if using) and set aside.

To shape the pizza dough, sprinkle the countertop and dough surface with flour
and lightly pat flat. Use a rolling pin to form a thin disk about 9 inches in
diameter. Transfer to a baking sheet.

Spread ricotta mixture over crust, top with ham and asparagus. Sprinkle with
Cheddar and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.

Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and bake for 5
minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to the top rack and bake for an additional
5 minutes.
