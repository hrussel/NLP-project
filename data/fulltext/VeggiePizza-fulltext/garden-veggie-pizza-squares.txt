Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Roll out crescent rolls onto a large non-stick baking sheet. Stretch and
flatten to form a single rectangular shape on the baking sheet. Bake 11 to 13
minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Allow to cool.

Place cream cheese in a medium bowl. Mix cream cheese with 1/2 of the ranch
dressing mix. Adjust the amount of dressing mix to taste. Spread the mixture
over the cooled crust. Arrange carrots, red bell pepper, broccoli and green
onions on top. Chill in the refrigerator approximately 1 hour. Cut into bite-
size squares to serve.
