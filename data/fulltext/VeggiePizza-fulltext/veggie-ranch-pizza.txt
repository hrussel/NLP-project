Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place pizza crust on a pizza pan or baking sheet, and spread dressing evenly
over the top. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, followed by carrots, cauliflower,
broccoli, onion, red pepper, and mushrooms. Top with mozzarella cheese.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until vegetables are tender, and
cheese is melted and lightly browned.
