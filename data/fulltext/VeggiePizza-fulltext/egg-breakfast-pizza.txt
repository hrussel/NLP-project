Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place sausage in a large, deep
skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set
aside.

Place pizza crusts upside down on cookie sheets and bake for 5 to 7 minutes.
Do not allow to brown.

Beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Scramble eggs until firm.

Remove crusts from oven, turn right side up, spread 1/2 can of cream of celery
soup on top of each crust. Spread 1/2 of egg mixture on each crust. Sprinkle
bacon bits on one pizza and cooked sausage on the other. Cover each with
onions and peppers. Top each pizza with 2 cups of cheese.

Bake in preheated oven, for 25 to 30 minutes, until cheese is golden brown.
