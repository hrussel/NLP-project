Steps

In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about
10 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and shortening. Stir in the yeast
mixture. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly
floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly
oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil.
Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume,
about 45 minutes.

Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion until tender. Stir
in tomato paste and water. Season with sugar, salt, black pepper, garlic
powder, basil, oregano, marjoram, cumin, chili powder and red pepper flakes.
Simmer 15 to 20 minutes.

Recipe makes 2 (12 inch) pizzas. Divide dough in half, and spread onto pizza
pans. Cover with sauce, and desired toppings. Bake at 400 degrees for 20
minutes, or until crust is golden brown.
