Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pizza crusts out
onto baking sheets or pizza pans.

Place the spinach and Alfredo sauce in a saucepan, and warm over medium heat.
Stir occasionally. Spread 1tablespoon of olive oil onto each pizza crust.
Spoon half of the Alfredo and spinach onto each crust, then arrange artichoke
hearts over the sauce layer. Top each pizza with half of the mozzarella cheese
and Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle mushrooms and black olives on top.

Bake pizzas one at a time for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the
bottom is nicely browned.
