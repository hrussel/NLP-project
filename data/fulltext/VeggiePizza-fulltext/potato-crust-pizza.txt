Steps

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat a 16 inch pizza pan
with nonstick cooking spray.

Place sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble,
until evenly browned. Drain grease, and set aside.

In a large bowl, toss together the hash browns, salt, and 3/4 cup of the
cheese until evenly blended. Spread in an even layer on the pizza pan, and
pack down. Slice tomatoes thinly, and set on paper towels to drain. This will
keep them from being watery when they cook.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is nicely
browned on the top and bottom. Remove from the oven, and arrange tomato slices
all over the pizza. Sprinkle the remaining cheese, mushrooms and sausage
evenly over the pizza. Return to the hot oven and bake for another 5 to 10
minutes, until cheese is melted. Cool for at least 5 minutes before cutting
into slices.
