Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.

Unroll pizza dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten into desired
thickness.

Bake crust in the preheated oven until slightly cooked, 5 minutes.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until
fragrant and sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until tender,
10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; season with salt and black pepper.

Brush pizza crust with leftover oil and garlic from skillet. Distribute onion,
sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and provolone cheese onto pizza crust.
Sprinkle with herbes de Provence.

Bake pizza in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned and cheese is
melted, 10 to 15 minutes.
