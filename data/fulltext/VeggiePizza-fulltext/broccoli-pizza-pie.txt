Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but
still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.

Meanwhile, place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and
cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes; drain.

In a large bowl combine potatoes, broccoli, cheese, lemon juice, garlic,
basil, oregano and parsley. On a pizza pan or baking sheet, roll out 1 pizza
dough. Top with potato mixture and cover with second pizza dough; with
moistened fingers seal edges of dough together.

Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve with
warmed pizza sauce.
