Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add
very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute.

Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a
ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding
additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes.
Divide dough into 8 portions; cover. (If using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rise
at this point for 10 minutes.)

Pat each portion of dough with floured hands into an 8-inch circle on a
greased baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough. Add a
second crust to the same baking sheet.

Bake for 6 to 7 minutes, dough will be just set and only lightly browned on
the bottom. Remove crusts to a wire rack to cool. Continue with remaining
pizza dough. (Works best to use several baking sheets.) May use crusts
immediately or place in freezer bags and freeze for up to 1 month.

When ready to bake, preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Spread each crust with
pizza sauce. Top with desired toppings to make Halloween designs! Repeat with
remaining pizzas. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, until
cheese is melted and lightly browned and bottom of crust is browned.
