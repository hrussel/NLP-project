Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with
aluminum foil. Lightly grease the foil.

Arrange the potato slices on the prepared baking sheet, and drizzle with oil.
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven.

Remove potatoes from heat, and turn. Drizzle with sauce, and top with green
pepper, onion, mushrooms, and pepperoni. Top with mozzarella cheese.

Return topped potatoes to the oven, and continue baking 10 minutes, or until
cheese is melted.
