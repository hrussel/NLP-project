Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook the ground beef and
onion in a large skillet over medium heat until evenly browned. Drain off
grease. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

Spread the sliced potatoes in a layer on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking
dish. Spread the ground beef and onion over the potatoes. Place slices of
pepperoni over the ground beef. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the
tomato soup, Cheddar cheese soup, and milk. Season with oregano, Italian
seasoning, and brown sugar. Mix well, and cook until heated through. Pour over
the contents of the baking dish.

Cover the dish with aluminum foil, and bake for 30 minutes in the preheated
oven. Remove the aluminum foil, sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the top, and
bake for an additional 15 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
