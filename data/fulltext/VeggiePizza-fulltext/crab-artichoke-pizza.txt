crab-artichoke-pizza

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.

Roll out pizza dough on a floured surface to a 14 or 16 inch circle; place
onto a pizza pan. Sprinkle dough with red pepper flakes, then top evenly with
crab and artichokes. Drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle with garlic,
Parmesan cheese, and mozzarella cheese.

Bake in preheated oven until the cheese has melted and the crust is no longer
doughy, about 20 minutes. Set oven to broil, and cook pizza for 5 minutes more
until the cheese has begun to brown.
