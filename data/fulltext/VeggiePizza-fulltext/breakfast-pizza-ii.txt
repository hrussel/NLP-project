Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place sausage in a large, deep
skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set
aside.

Line the bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch baking dish with crescent rolls.
Cover rolls with sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, 1 cup Cheddar cheese and 1 cup
mozzarella cheese.

Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until crust is golden brown.
Remove from oven. In a large bowl, beat together eggs, Worcestershire sauce,
salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over crust. Bake for another 7 to 9 minutes,
or until eggs are set. Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
