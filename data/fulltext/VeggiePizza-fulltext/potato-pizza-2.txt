Steps

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare instant mashed
potatoes according to package directions. Stir in half of the Cheddar cheese,
bacon bits, and green onions.

Cut the pizza crust dough in half, and spread into the bottom of two 8-inch
round pans. Bake for 4 minutes in the preheated oven, until about halfway
done. Spoon the potato mixture over each crust. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar
cheese over the top.

Bake for an additional 5 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is golden,
and cheese is melted. Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Top
with sour cream to taste.
