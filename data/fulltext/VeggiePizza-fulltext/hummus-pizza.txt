hummus-pizza

Steps

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees C (220 degrees C).

Roll out pizza crust and place on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread a thin
layer of hummus over the crust. Arrange sliced peppers and broccoli over the
hummus, and top with shredded cheese.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is golden
brown and cheese is melted in the center. Slice and serve.
