Steps

Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In 6-inch nonstick skillet, cook sausage over
medium-high heat 4 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently, until no longer pink.
Stir in mushrooms, tomatoes and pizza sauce. Remove from heat; cover to keep
warm.

Spray bottom and side of 12-inch cast-iron skillet or other ovenproof skillet
with cooking spray. Unroll dough in skillet; press in bottom and at least
halfway up side. Bake 5 minutes. Sprinkle 1 3/4 cups of the cheese over dough.
Spoon sausage and vegetable mixture over cheese; top with remaining 1/4 cup
cheese.

Bake 15 to 18 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Sprinkle with green
onions. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting. To serve, cut into 6 wedges.
