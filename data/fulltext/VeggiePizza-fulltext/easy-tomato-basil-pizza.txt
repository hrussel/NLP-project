Steps

Mix the tomatoes and salt in a mesh strainer. Let mixture sit and drain for 15
minutes.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

Combine the drained tomatoes, 8 ounces of mozzarella cheese, onion, basil,
pepper, olive oil, jalapenos, olives, and mushrooms in a bowl. Spread the
pizza sauce evenly onto the pizza crusts. Distribute tomato mixture over the
two pizza crusts evenly. Sprinkle 8 ounces of mozzarella cheese and the
Parmesan cheese over both pizzas.

Bake pizzas in preheated oven until cheese is completely melted, 8 to 10
minutes.
