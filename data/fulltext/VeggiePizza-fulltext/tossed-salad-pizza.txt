Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add
very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute.

Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a
ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding
additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. (If
using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rest at this point for 10 minutes.)

Pat dough with floured hands to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. OR
roll dough on a floured counter to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan
or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough.

Brush crust with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder.
Combine mozzarella cheese, onions and carrots; spread over the crust.

Bake on lowest oven rack for 15 to 18 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and
crust is browned. Remove from oven and let cool 2 to 3 minutes. While pizza is
baking, toss together lettuce, tomatoes and Italian salad dressing. Spread
over pizza and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately!
