Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until
evenly brown. Drain off grease and add eggs. Cook eggs and sausage together
until eggs are set.

Place pizza crust on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread crust with ricotta
cheese leaving the outer edge of the crust bare. Spread the egg and sausage
mixture over the ricotta cheese. Sprinkle with onion, tomato, red pepper and
green pepper. Top with mozzarella.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese and edges of crust are
golden brown.
