Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Roll out the crescent roll dough onto a 9x13 inch baking sheet, and pinch
together edges to form the pizza crust.

Bake crust for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Once finished cooking, remove
crust from oven and let cool 15 minutes without removing it from the baking
sheet.

In a small mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, mayonnaise, and dry Ranch
dressing. Spread the mixture over the cooled crust. Arrange broccoli, tomato,
green bell pepper, cauliflower, shredded carrots, and Cheddar cheese over the
cream cheese layer. Chill for one hour, slice and serve.
