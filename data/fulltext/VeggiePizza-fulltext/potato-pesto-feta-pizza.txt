potato-pesto-feta-pizza

Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Scrub and dry potatoes, then prick several times with a fork and place onto a
baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are easily pierced
with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove, cool, and cut into slices about
1/4-inch thick.

Sprinkle cornmeal over a half sheet pan. Stretch pizza dough over cornmeal to
fit the pan; spread pesto sauce over dough.

Lay potatoes over the pesto in a single layer; season with salt and pepper to
taste and sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over potatoes. Sprinkle Fontina
cheese, red onion slices, and feta cheese on top.

Bake in the preheated oven on the bottom rack for 10 minutes. Transfer pan to
the middle rack and bake until crust is light golden and crisp, 5 to 7
minutes.
