Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place the pizza crust on a large cookie tray or pizza pan. Brush the crust
evenly with olive oil. Spread tomato sauce over it with a spatula or back of a
spoon. Sprinkle vegetables evenly over the sauce, and top with cheese.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cheese has melted and is bubbly. Let cool
for 2 to 3 minutes before cutting.
