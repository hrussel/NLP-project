Steps

Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).

Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
pancetta until fat has been released, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer pancetta to a
paper towel-lined plate.

Pour remaining 5 teaspoons olive oil into the same skillet; cook and stir
garlic until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Add Brussels sprouts to garlic; cook,
stirring constantly, until sprouts begin to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer
sprouts and garlic to a bowl and crumble cooled pancetta over the mixture. Add
mozzarella cheese and fennel seed; toss to coat. Place pizza crust onto a
baking sheet and spread Brussels sprouts mixture atop pizza crust.

Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 10
minutes.
