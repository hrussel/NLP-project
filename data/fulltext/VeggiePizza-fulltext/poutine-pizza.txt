Steps

Place flour in a large bowl. Whisk water, egg, yeast, and sugar together in a
cup. Make a well in the flour and pour in yeast mixture. Stir until mixture
forms a smooth dough, adding a small amount of flour or water if needed. Cover
bowl with a towel; set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread French fries in a single
layer on a baking sheet.

Bake fries in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Reduce oven
temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Heat a large skillet over medium heat and fry bacon pieces until browned,
about 5 minutes; remove to drain on a paper towel.

Spray a round pizza pan with baking spray.

Punch down dough, and flatten onto pizza pan. For a stuffed crust, sprinkle
about 1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend around the edge of the dough, roll
dough inward over cheese, and pinch dough to seal.

Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over dough. Spread fries over dough; pour
gravy over fries as needed to cover. Top with remaining Mexican cheese blend.
Sprinkle bacon pieces evenly over pizza.

Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden, about
20 minutes.
