Steps

Place green bell pepper, carrot, and garlic cloves into a food processor and
pulse a few times until the vegetables are very finely chopped.

Transfer chopped vegetables into a large saucepan. Stir in tomato puree,
crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, basil, and red pepper flakes; bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until sauce has thickened, about
30 minutes. Stir in olive oil and simmer 1 to 2 more minutes. Sauce may be
refrigerated up to 1 week.
