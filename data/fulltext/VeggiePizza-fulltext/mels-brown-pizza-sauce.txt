Steps

Working in batches, puree onions, celery, mushrooms, and garlic and 1/4 cup

necessary.

Stir vegetable puree and remaining chicken broth together in large pot; bring
to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors blend, about 45
minutes.

Stir tomato paste, oregano, black pepper, sugar, celery salt, basil, onion
powder, and seasoned salt into broth mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to
