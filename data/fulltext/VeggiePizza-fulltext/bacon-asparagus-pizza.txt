Steps

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes to
release most of the grease, but do not cook until crisp. Remove to paper
towels to drain.

Spread the pizza crust out on a pizza pan or large baking sheet. Top with
mozzarella cheese, bacon pieces, asparagus, and tomatoes. Dot with goat
cheese, then season with red pepper flakes and black pepper.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is golden
brown underneath when you lift it up to take a peek. Let cool for about 5
minutes before slicing and serving.
