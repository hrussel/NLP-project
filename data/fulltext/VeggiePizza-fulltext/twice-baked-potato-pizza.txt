Steps

Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Spray large cookie sheet with cooking spray.
Unroll pizza dough on cookie sheet; press into 15x12-inch rectangle. Bake 6 to
8 minutes or until light golden brown.

Spread 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the cooking sauce evenly over partially
baked crust (using more sauce will make crust soggy). Arrange potato slices in
single layer over sauce. Sprinkle with bacon and cheese. Bake 8 to 10 minutes
or until crust is golden brown. Meanwhile, heat remaining sauce until hot.

Sprinkle with olives, tomatoes and green onions. Serve with sauce as a dipping
sauce.
