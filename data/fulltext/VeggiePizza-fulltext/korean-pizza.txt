Steps

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, eggs, water and salt. It will be very
watery, as the pizza is like a crepe. Stir in the crabmeat, pork, tofu, bean
sprouts, mixed vegetables, and cabbage until well blended.

Heat some of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Your pizzas will be
the size of your skillet. Spoon in enough of the vegetable batter to cover the
bottom of the pan. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until the underside is golden
brown. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes. The
edges should be crispy. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve pizzas with
dipping sauce.

To make the dipping sauce, mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame
oil and chile pepper in a sealable container. Seal, and shake until well
blended. Shake again just before serving.
