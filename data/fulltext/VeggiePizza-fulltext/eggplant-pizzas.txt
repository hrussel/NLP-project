eggplant-pizzas

Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Beat the eggs in a bowl. Mix the flour, salt, pepper, and oregano in a 1
gallon resealable plastic bag. Dip each eggplant slice in the egg, then drop
the eggplant in the flour mixture one at a time, shaking the bag to coat the
eggplant.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Place the
eggplant slices in the skillet to cook, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned. Drain the eggplant slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Arrange the
eggplant in one layer on a baking sheet. Spoon enough pizza sauce to cover
each eggplant slice. Top each eggplant with mozzarella cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven until the mozzarella cheese is melted, 5 to 10
minutes.
