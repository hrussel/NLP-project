Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Season with salt. Stir
in butter, mushrooms, onion, and garlic; cook until the onions are soft.

In a small bowl, stir together white wine and flour. Stir into meat, along
with mushroom soup and beef broth. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, allowing to
thicken. (If you need more liquid, stir in additional broth.) Serve seasoned
with a dash of Worcestershire sauce.
