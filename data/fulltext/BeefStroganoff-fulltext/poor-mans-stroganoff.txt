Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes; drain.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot
skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Season beef with Greek seasoning, salt, and pepper.

Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir
mushrooms in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; add to ground beef.

Stir sour cream into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until hot, about 5
minutes. Serve over egg noodles.
