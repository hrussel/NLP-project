beef-stroganoff-with-white-wine

Steps

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the
mushrooms, onion and garlic in the butter until tender. Reserving the liquid
in the saucepan, remove the mushroom mixture to a bowl. Return the butter
mixture to medium-high heat.

Whisk together the flour and half-and-half until smooth; set aside.

Season the beef with salt and pepper; cook the beef in the reserved liquid
until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the wine, beef bouillon, thyme, basil,
oregano, bay leaves, and pepper; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10
minutes. Slowly stir in the flour mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally,
until the sauce thickens, 20 to 30 minutes. Add the mushroom mixture and stir.
