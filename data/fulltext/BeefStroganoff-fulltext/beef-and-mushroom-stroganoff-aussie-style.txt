Steps

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic,
and fresh mushrooms; cook until the onions are translucent. Stir in curry
powder until well blended. Place the meat strips in the skillet, and fry until
evenly browned.

Dissolve the bouillon cubes in the boiling water, then stir into the skillet.
Add the mushroom stems and pieces and dried shiitake mushrooms. Let the
mixture simmer over medium heat until most of the liquid has evaporated, about
20 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the
noodles and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain.

Reduce the heat under the skillet to low, and pour in the cream, stirring
until the sauce is an even color. Simmer for about 5 minutes, but do not boil.
Serve over noodles.
