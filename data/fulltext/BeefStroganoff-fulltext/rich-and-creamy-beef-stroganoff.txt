Steps

Place the beef into a large bowl. Stir in the red wine, salt, and black
pepper. Marinate for 10 minutes, then remove the beef and pat dry with a paper
towel. Reserve the remaining marinade.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the beef; cook
and stir until browned, then transfer to a plate, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any
remaining grease from the skillet. Melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat.
Stir in the onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Cook and stir until the onion
is soft and translucent. Transfer the onion mixture to the plate with the
prepared beef; set aside.

Melt another 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet over medium heat, and
stir in the mushrooms. Cook and stir until the mushrooms are tender, about 10
minutes. Place the cooked mushrooms in a bowl and set aside. Melt 1/4 cup of
butter in the skillet. Whisk in the flour, cook and stir until the flour no
longer tastes raw, about 4 minutes. Slowly whisk in the beef stock. Bring to a
boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to medium low. Pour in the
reserved red wine marinade, Worcestershire sauce, prepared mustard, and red
pepper flakes, then add the beef and onion mixture. Cover and simmer until the
meat is tender, about 1 hour. Season with salt and black pepper.

Stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and cream cheese about 5 minutes before
serving.
