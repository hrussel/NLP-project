Steps

Melt butter in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion
until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and continue to cook and
stir until mushrooms are soft and liquid has evaporated, about 5 more minutes.
Transfer onion and mushrooms to a bowl.

Cook and stir beef sirloin cubes in the same skillet over medium heat until
the cubes are browned on all sides and liquid has evaporated, about 10
minutes.

Pour 2/3 of the beef consomme into the skillet; scrape up and dissolve any
brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring mixture to a boil; set
remaining consomme aside.

Mix in garlic, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, and hot
sauce. Reduce heat to low and simmer beef mixture until tender, at least 30
minutes. Simmer longer for more tender beef.

Whisk remaining 1/3 can beef consomme with flour in a small bowl until smooth;
stir into the beef mixture, return to a boil, and simmer the meat and sauce
until thickened, 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir in cooked onion and mushrooms and
cook until heated through.

Remove from heat, stir in sour cream, and serve.
