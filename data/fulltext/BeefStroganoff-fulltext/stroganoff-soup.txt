Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook
for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain and rinse under hot water.

In a slow cooker, combine the soup, 2 2/3 cup (or 2 soup cans) of water, sour
cream and steak sauce. Mix until smooth. Add cooked steak pieces, onions and
cooked noodles. Cook on low for 2 hours, or to desired taste and consistency.

In a large skillet, brown the round steak pieces with the onion to desired
doneness.
