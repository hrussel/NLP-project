Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at
a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite,
about 12 minutes; drain and transfer to a serving bowl.

Heat olive oil and butter together in a large frying pan; cook and stir
mushrooms, onions, and garlic in the oil-butter mixture until mushrooms are
tender, 5 to 10 minutes.

Stir cream cheese, white wine, tomato paste, lemon juice, cornstarch, beef
bouillon, parsley, seasoned salt, and paprika together in a bowl; add steak.
Pour cream cheese mixture into frying pan with mushroom mixture; cook and
gently stir mixture over low heat just until sauce is warmed and smooth, 5 to
10 minutes. Add enough milk to reach desired consistency.

Pour sauce over pasta and toss to coat. Season with black pepper.
