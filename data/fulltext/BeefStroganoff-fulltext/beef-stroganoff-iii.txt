Steps

Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch thick
by 2 inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper.

In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and brown the beef strips
quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook
slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips.

Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef
broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in
mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.

Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white
wine. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste.
