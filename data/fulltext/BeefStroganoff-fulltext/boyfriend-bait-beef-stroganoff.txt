Steps

Over medium high heat, gently cook beef tenderloin in 2 tablespoons of butter
for about 2 minutes, until just seared on all sides. You will still be able to
see red. Remove from pan and set aside in a rimmed dish or baking sheet so
that you collect the juices.

Return the pan to medium-high heat and cook the shallots and mushrooms in
remaining butter until soft and wilted, about 5 minutes. Mix cornstarch into
cold beef broth, whisk to blend. Pour into pan, and stir together with
shallots and mushrooms until thickened, two or three minutes.

Add sour cream and mustard, stir to blend. Add beef and juices from dish; stir
over medium just till warmed through. Salt to taste.
