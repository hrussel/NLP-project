Steps

Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef
and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Add the onion, garlic and
parsley and cook until the onion is tender-crisp.

Stir the broth and mushrooms in the skillet and heat to a boil. Stir in the
noodles. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the
noodles are tender.

Stir the sour cream in the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot. Garnish
with the parsley.
