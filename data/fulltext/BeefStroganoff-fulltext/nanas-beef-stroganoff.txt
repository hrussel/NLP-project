Steps

Shake 1 tablespoon flour with salt in a large, resealable plastic bag until
combined; add beef and shake to coat.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown beef in
the hot butter, about 3 minutes per side. Stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic
into beef; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer
beef and vegetables to a bowl, leaving drippings in skillet.

Melt 2 more tablespoons butter in skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir 3
tablespoons flour in the hot butter until smooth; stir tomato paste into flour
mixture. Whisk beef stock into mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until
sauce is thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes.

Return beef and vegetables to skillet and stir to coat with sauce. Reduce heat
to very low and simmer until beef is tender, 2 to 3 hours. The longer it
cooks, the more tender the meat will be. Just before serving, stir sour cream
and white wine into beef mixture and heat through. Do not boil.
