Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and cook kluski noodles
until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, chop noodles into small pieces, and set
aside.

Cook cabbage and onion, covered, in a large pot with water over medium heat
until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over
medium heat and transfer cabbage and onion into skillet with a slotted spoon.
Cook in the hot oil until vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes; stir in
kielbasa and continue to cook until sausage is heated through. Stir mustard
seeds into cabbage mixture; season to taste with salt and black pepper. Stir
chopped kluski into the mixture.

Pour eggs over the noodle mixture and stir until eggs are set, 3 to 5 minutes.
