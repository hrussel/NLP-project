Steps

Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, and brown meat on all sides in hot
oil.

In large bowl combine tomatoes, pizza sauce, cheese, Worcestershire sauce,
garlic, salt, oregano, and pepper. Pour over meat. Cover and simmer over
medium heat for 2 hours, turning meat each half hour.

Remove meat from pan, and cool slightly. Skim fat from pan juices. Measure
juices, and add enough water to make 6 cups liquid. Return liquid to Dutch
oven. Blend cornstarch and 3 tablespoons cold water; stir into pan juices.
Cook and stir till thickened and bubbly.

Slice meat thinly against the grain. Return meat to pot, and add mushrooms.
Simmer for 30 minutes longer.

Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until done. Drain. To serve, place
meat slices over hot noodles, and pour some sauce over. Pass remaining sauce.
