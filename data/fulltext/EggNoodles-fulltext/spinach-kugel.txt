spinach-kugel

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water; bring to a rolling boil over high
heat. Stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta until
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink.

Combine the eggs, melted butter, sour cream, soup mix, and pepper in a large
bowl. Stir in the cooked noodles, and drained spinach. Spoon into prepared
baking dish.

Bake in preheated oven until hot and golden brown, about 60 minutes. Cover
dish with aluminum foil if kugel begins to brown too quickly.
