Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir
in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain
well.

Melt butter in a large skillet or wok over medium heat; cook and stir onion
until browned, about 8 minutes.

Cook and stir cabbage into onions until cabbage has wilted, another 5 to 8
minutes.

Gently stir cooked noodles into cabbage mixture; season with salt and black
pepper to taste.
