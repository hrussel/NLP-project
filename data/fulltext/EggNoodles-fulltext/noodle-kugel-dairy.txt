Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 1-quart baking dish
with nonstick cooking spray.

In a bowl, mix together the eggs with white sugar until thoroughly combined,
then stir in the melted butter, whipped cottage cheese, sour cream, salt, and
pepper. Lightly mix in the noodles; spoon the kugel into the prepared baking
dish. Sprinkle the top with brown sugar.

Bake in the preheated oven until the top has browned, about 40 minutes. Cool
for 10 minutes before serving.
