kapusta-ii

Steps

Place the salt pork in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring
frequently until the fat has melted down and the meaty parts are cooked. Add
shredded cabbage, and cook over medium-low heat until tender, stirring to coat
the cabbage with the salt pork drippings.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg
noodles, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain. When the cabbage has
cooked completely, stir egg noodles into the cabbage, and season with black
pepper to taste.
