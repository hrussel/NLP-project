Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Stir cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and Worcestershire sauce in bowl
until well blended. Pour half the soup mixture in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Arrange chicken breast halves in baking dish and cover with remaining soup
mixture.

Bake chicken in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the
juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.

Cut chicken into bite-size pieces and serve over egg noodles with mushroom
sauce.
