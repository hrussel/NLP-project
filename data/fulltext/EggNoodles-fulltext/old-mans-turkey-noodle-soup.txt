Steps

Combine the turkey drumsticks and water in a large soup pot and bring to a
boil. Stir in onions, carrots, celery, garlic, salt, black pepper, sage,
thyme, rosemary, and celery salt; reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the
turkey meat is very tender, about 2 hours. Remove the turkey drumsticks and
allow to cool. When cool enough to handle, strip the meat from the bones and
tendons, chop the meat, and return to the soup.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook
the egg noodles a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 5
minutes. Drain. Scoop noodles into soup bowls and fill the bowls with turkey
soup.
