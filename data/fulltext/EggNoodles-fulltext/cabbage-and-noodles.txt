cabbage-and-noodles

Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Stir in the egg noodles; return to a boil. Cook, uncovered,
stirring occasionally, until the noodles are cooked through, but still firm to
the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain; return to the pot and stir in the butter.

Meanwhile, place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the
bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.

Place the onion into the skillet with the bacon grease, and cook and stir over
medium heat until the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the
cabbage, and cook and stir until wilted, about 5 minutes. Chop the bacon, add
it to the skillet, and cook until the cabbage is tender, about 10 minutes.
Stir in the noodles, and continue cooking just until heated through.
