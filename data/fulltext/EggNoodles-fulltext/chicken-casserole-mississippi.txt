Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole
dish.

Cut the chicken into bite size pieces. Place the chicken and onion into a
large nonstick skillet and sprinkle with seasoning salt. Cook over medium
heat, stirring occasionally, until chicken juices run clear and onion is
transparent, 5 to 10 minutes.

Prepare the egg noodles according to package directions. Combine the chicken
and onion mixture, soups, and noodles in the prepared casserole dish and toss
to mix together evenly. Crush the crackers in a medium bowl. Stir in the
butter and sour cream. Mix thoroughly and spread over the chicken mixture.

Bake in preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
