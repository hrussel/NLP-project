Steps

Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water until al dente. Drain.

Meanwhile, mix together tahini, lemon juice, and water until smooth. Add
garlic, yogurt, and pepper sauce.

In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Saute red pepper and
zucchini in oil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender crisp. Add tahini sauce,
and heat through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Do not boil or
overcook: this sauce curdles easily. Toss noodles with sauce.
