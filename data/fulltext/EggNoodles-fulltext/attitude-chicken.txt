Steps

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
cubed chicken, and cook just until it turns white on the outside. Add the
onion, garlic, and mushrooms. Saute until onions begin to turn clear. Pour in
just enough Italian dressing to coat the chicken mixture, then add 1
tablespoon of lemon juice. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer while you
make the sauce.

Combine cream of chicken soup with milk in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Heat through, but do not allow it to boil. When the mixture is thoroughly
heated, stir in 4 tablespoons of lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper
to taste. Be careful with the lemon - if you add it too soon the milk will
curdle. The result of it done correctly will be a shiny smooth sauce.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles,
and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.

Fit a steamer basket into a saucepan, and add one inch of water, 1 tablespoon
of butter, and remaining 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. Bring to a boil, and add
broccoli. Cover, and allow the broccoli to steam for 5 minutes, or until
tender, but still bright green.

To finish the dish, mix together the sauce and noodles, and place them on a
serving platter. Top with chicken in the center, and arrange broccoli around
the outside edge.
