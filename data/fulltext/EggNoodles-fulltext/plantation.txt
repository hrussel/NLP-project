Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles, and cook
until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain.

Meanwhile, crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Season with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper; cook and stir until
evenly browned. Drain off grease.

Stir the cream cheese and cream of mushroom soup into the ground beef until
well blended. Mix in the drained noodles and corn. Stir in evaporated milk to
reach your desired consistency. Top with mozzarella cheese, and serve.
