Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large serving bowl.

Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in
the hot butter until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Place flour, milk,
and half-and-half in a jar with a lid and shake until flour has smoothly mixed
with milk and half-and-half. Pour mixture into skillet and whisk until smooth
and thick, about 5 minutes.

Gradually whisk chicken broth into sauce and bring to a simmer, whisking
constantly. Stir cooked chicken and sour cream into sauce, season with salt
and black pepper, and mix with cooked noodles to serve.
