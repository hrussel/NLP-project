Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Grease a 2-quart baking dish.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.

Stir melted butter and noodles in a large bowl.

Mix apples, egg yolks, sugar, raisins, cinnamon, and vanilla extract into
noodle mixture until well blended.

Beat egg whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or
whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its
shape.

Fold egg whites into noodle mixture; pour into prepared baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 40 minutes.
