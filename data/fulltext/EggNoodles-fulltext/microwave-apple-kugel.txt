Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink.

Grease an 8-inch square microwave-safe glass baking dish. Beat the eggs
together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the cooked noodles, white sugar, chopped
apples, sour cream, cottage cheese, cinnamon, salt, and raisins; mix until
combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared dish.

Microwave on medium high (70% power) for 7 minutes.

Combine the brown sugar and chopped walnuts in a bowl, and cut in the butter
to form a crumbly topping. Sprinkle the topping over the pudding. Return the
pudding to the microwave and cook on medium high (70% power) until the pudding
is firm in the center, 7 to 9 minutes.
