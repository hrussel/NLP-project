meatballs-in-sour-cream-gravy

Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place egg noodles in the
pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.

In a bowl, mix the beef, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, pepper, eggs, and onion. Form
into small meatballs around the olives.

Heat the oil in skillet over medium heat, and cook the meatballs until evenly
brown. Remove meatballs from skillet, reserving oil; set meatballs aside, and
keep warm.

Stir the flour into the reserved oil in the skillet. Gradually mix in water to
form a thick gravy. Stir in sour cream, dill, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt,
and cook until heated through. Pour over the meatballs, and serve over cooked
egg noodles.
