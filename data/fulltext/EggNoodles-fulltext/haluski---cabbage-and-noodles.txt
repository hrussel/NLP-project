haluski---cabbage-and-noodles

Steps

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir
in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain
well.

Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir
onions until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.

Cook and stir remaining butter and cabbage into onions until cabbage is
softened but not browned, 5 to 8 more minutes. Season with salt and black
pepper.

Place cooked noodles and cabbage mixture in a large roasting pan and stir
gently to combine. Sprinkle with more salt and black pepper if desired.

Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 30 to 40 minutes.
