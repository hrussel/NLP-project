ground-turkey-casserole

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute the ground turkey for 5 to 10
minutes, or until browned. Drain the turkey, stir in the tomato sauce and
sugar, and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the sour cream and cream
cheese. Mix well and set aside.

Cook noodles according to package directions. Place them into a 9x13-inch
baking dish, then layer the turkey mixture over the noodles. Then layer the
sour cream mixture over the turkey, and top with cheese.

Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 35 minutes, or until cheese is
melted and bubbly.
