Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.

Beat eggs, cottage cheese, milk, sour cream, 1 cup white sugar, butter, cream
cheese, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl.

Stir egg noodles into cottage cheese mixture, then pour into prepared baking
dish.

Combine 1/3 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl;
sprinkle mixture atop noodle kugel.

Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and noodles are golden, about
1 hour. Allow pan of kugel to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before
serving.
