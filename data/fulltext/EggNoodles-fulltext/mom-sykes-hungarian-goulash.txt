Steps

Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the stew meat, caraway seeds,
onion and paprika. Cook and stir until the meat is browned, and the onions are
translucent. Add the garlic and lemon zest, and cook for about a minute, then
stir in the tomato paste and beef consomme, adding water if necessary to cover
the meat. Cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for 1 1/2 hours.

Just before the meat is done cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a
boil. Add egg noodles, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and serve
the goulash spooned over the egg noodles.
