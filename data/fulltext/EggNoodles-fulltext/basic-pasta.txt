Steps

In a medium sized bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the flour, add
the slightly beaten egg, and mix. Mixture should form a stiff dough. If
needed, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons water.

On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for about 3 to 4 minutes. With a
pasta machine or by hand roll dough out to desired thinness. Use machine or
knife to cut into strips of desired width.
