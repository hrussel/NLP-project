tofu-stroganoff

Steps

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place egg noodles in the pot, cook for 8
to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the tofu 5 minutes on
each side, until lightly browned. Set aside. Place the onions in the skillet,
and cook until tender. Mix in mushrooms, garlic, and soy sauce, and cook until
heated through.

In a bowl, mix the cottage cheese, sour cream, and dill. Stir into the
skillet. Return tofu to skillet, and continue cooking just until heated
through. Serve over the cooked noodles.
