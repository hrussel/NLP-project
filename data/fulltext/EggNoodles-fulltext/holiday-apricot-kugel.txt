Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x12 inch baking dish.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook
for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

In a large bowl, stir together the apricot preserves, eggs, butter, sugar,
vanilla extract, and salt, and mix to thoroughly combine. Fold in the cottage
cheese and noodles, and spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until the center of the kugel is cooked and set,
about 50 minutes. Remove the kugel and top with Cheddar cheese, return to the
oven, and bake until the cheese is browned and bubbling, about 10 minutes. Let
the kugel rest for 10 minutes before serving.
