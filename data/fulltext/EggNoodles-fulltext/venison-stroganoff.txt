venison-stroganoff

Steps

Season venison with salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. Saute onion in a
large skillet; when soft, add venison and brown. Drain when venison is no
longer pink and add soup. Reduce heat to low and simmer.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles
and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

When noodles are almost done cooking, stir sour cream into meat mixture. Pour
meat mixture over hot cooked noodles and serve.
