Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking
dish.

Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook
and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion
is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Meanwhile, combine eggs, salt, and
pepper in a large bowl. Stir in the noodles and onion. Pour noodle mixture
into the prepared baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven until noodles are golden brown, 45 minutes to 1
hour.
