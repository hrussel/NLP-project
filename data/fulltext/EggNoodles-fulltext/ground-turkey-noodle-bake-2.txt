Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square
baking dish.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes; drain.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in turkey and onion. Cook
and stir until turkey mixture is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink,
about 10 minutes; drain. Stir in tomato sauce and Italian seasoning; bring to
a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.

Combine milk, cream cheese, parsley, and garlic in a small saucepan. Cook and
stir over medium heat until cream cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Toss noodles with cream cheese mixture; transfer to prepared baking dish. Top
with turkey mixture and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.

Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, 15 to 30 minutes.
