noodles-napoli

Steps

Mix beef and sausage into 1 or 2 flat patties. In a large skillet over medium
to medium-high heat, salt patties and brown well on each side. Remove meat and
set aside.

Saute onion and garlic in the drippings. Remove with a slotted spoon and add
to the platter with the meat.

In the drippings, carefully brown a single layer of the raw noodles until
golden, remove and do another layer until all are done.

Return all the noodles to the skillet with the garlic, onions, peppers,
crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce and water. Break the meat patty into large
chunks, gently stir all together and simmer 1/2 hour or so. Add a little water
as the noodles absorb the juices. This should not be soupy, just thick and
dry. Stir in the grated cheese and let it melt into the sauce. It sticks
easily at this point, so don't overcook. This reheats well in a slow cooker or
casserole.
