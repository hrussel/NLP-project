Steps

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink.

Place noodles in a large bowl. Mix margarine into the noodles until melted.
Stir in the eggs, sugar, applesauce, and vanilla extract. Pour noodle mixture
into a 9x13 inch baking pan, then sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover baking pan
with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover the kugel and bake until
golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
