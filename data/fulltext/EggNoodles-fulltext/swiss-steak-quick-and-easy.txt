Steps

Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Dredge steak strips in flour.
Working in batches, place strips in hot oil. Fry until browned on both sides.
Remove to a warm platter. When all meat is browned, return meat to Dutch oven,
and stir in onions, mushrooms, salt, pepper, gravy mix, and stewed tomatoes.
Bring to a boil, then simmer about 30 to 45 minutes.

About 20 minutes before steak is finished, fill a large pot with water and
bring to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes;
drain.

Serve Swiss steak over noodles.
