Steps

Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir steak in hot oil until
browned completely, about 5 minutes.

Stir water, ketchup, onion, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, paprika,
mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper with the beef in the pot; bring to a boil,
reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until meat is tender and the sauce
thickens, 2 to 3 hours.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes; drain.

Ladle beef mixture over noodles to serve.
