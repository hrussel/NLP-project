Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in the flour and heat
until bubbly. Slowly add the milk, stirring constantly, until mixture is
thickened and smooth.

Remove from heat and stir in the chicken, ham, noodles, celery, salt and
ground black pepper. Transfer this mixture to a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish.

Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Remove from oven,
sprinkle with the cheese and top with paprika, as desired. Return to oven and
bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.
