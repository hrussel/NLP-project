Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish with melted butter.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.

Mix the apple and pear with lemon juice in a bowl; set aside.

Beat milk, eggs, applesauce, white sugar, light brown sugar, vanilla extract,
cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl until just combined.

Stir cranberries, egg noodles, and apple mixture into the egg mixture; pour in
prepared baking dish and cover baking dish with aluminum foil.

Bake noodle pudding in preheated oven until set, 35 to 45 minutes.

Remove foil and return pudding to oven to bake until browned, about 10 minutes
more; cool to room temperature or serve chilled.
