Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Combine mushroom soup, milk, and tuna in a saucepan over medium heat; cook
until well blended and warmed through, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a
9x13-inch baking dish; add noodles and mix well. Top noodles with cheese food
and sprinkle potato chips over cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes.
