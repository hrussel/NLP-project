Steps

Cook egg noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 5 to 7 minutes, or until
al dente. Drain, and set aside.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat, cook potstickers until
golden brown, turning once or twice. Add the water to the pan, reduce heat to
low, cover, and cook for another 3 minutes, or until liquid has evaporated.
Rinse with cold water to cool, drain, and cut in half.

In a large mixing bowl, toss together the water chestnuts, baby corn, carrot,
mushrooms, peanut sauce, noodles, and potstickers. Chill 1 hour. Toss with
peanuts just before serving.
