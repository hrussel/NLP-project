Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the egg noodles and
cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain, and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large bowl, mix together the tomato soup, corn, onion, and cream of
mushroom soup. Stir in the cooked noodles until well coated. Transfer to a
9x13 inch baking dish. Place slices of cheese to cover the top.

Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and
lightly browned.
