Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8
to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, and set aside.

Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium high heat, stirring to
crumble; drain, and set aside. Heat oil in a separate skillet over medium high
heat. Cook potatoes for 2 minutes, then stir in onion. Continue cooking until
well browned, then carefully drain excess oil.

Combine potatoes with ground beef mixture, and stir in tomato sauce and cubed
cheese. When cheese has melted, stir in noodles and continue cooking 15
minutes more. Serve immediately.
