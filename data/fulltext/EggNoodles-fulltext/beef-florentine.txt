Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8
to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until evenly brown; drain
excess fat. Season with oregano, salt and pepper. Stir in tomato sauce and

In a medium bowl, combine spinach, cottage cheese, onion, and Parmesan cheese.
Spread half of noodle mixture in a large casserole dish. Layer with all of
spinach mixture, then cover with remaining noodle mixture.

cooking 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
