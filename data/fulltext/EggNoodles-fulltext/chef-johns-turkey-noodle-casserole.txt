Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in
boiling water, stirring occasionally until almost cooked through and still
firm to the bite, about 4 minutes. Drain.

Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour; cook,
stirring, until mixture is light golden, about 3 minutes.

Pour milk into butter and flour mixture, whisking constantly. Stir in cream of
mushroom soup, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, green onions, garam masala,
and dried tarragon. Bring mixture to a simmer, cook for 2 minutes. Remove from
heat.

Stir in pepperjack cheese until cheese is melted and incorporated.

Stir pepperjack cheese mixture, turkey meat, and noodles in a large bowl until
evenly incorporated. Pour mixture into a large casserole dish. Sprinkle chips
on top, pressing down slightly with the tines of a fork. Bake in the preheated
oven until casserole top is golden brown and sauce is bubbling, about 30
minutes.
