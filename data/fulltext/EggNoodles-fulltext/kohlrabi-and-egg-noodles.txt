kohlrabi-and-egg-noodles

Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in
boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes; drain.

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add kohlrabi, season with salt and
pepper, and cook until the kohlrabi is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the
drained egg noodles into the kohlrabi; cook and stir until the noodles are
slightly fried, 5 to 7 minutes.
