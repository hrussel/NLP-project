Steps

Melt butter in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the egg noodles and
stir until they begin to brown, being careful not to burn the butter. Stir in
the rice. Continue stirring until rice is coated with butter.

Pour in the chicken broth and add the bouillon cubes. Bring to a boil; reduce
heat to low and cover tightly. Cook without uncovering pot until all the
liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
