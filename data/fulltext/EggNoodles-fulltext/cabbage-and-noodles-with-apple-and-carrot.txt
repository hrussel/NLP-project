cabbage-and-noodles-with-apple-and-carrot

Steps

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; Cook and stir cabbage,
carrot, and apple until cabbage is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir
in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain
well.

Gently stir noodles into cabbage mixture; season to taste with salt and black
pepper.
