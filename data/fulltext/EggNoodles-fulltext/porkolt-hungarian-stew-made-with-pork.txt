Steps

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat until
evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, and reserve the drippings. Add the
onions to the bacon and cook together until the onion is translucent. Remove
skillet from heat and stir the paprika, garlic powder, and pepper into the
bacon mixture. Transfer the mixture into a large stockpot.

Heat a small amount of the reserved bacon drippings in the skillet again over
medium-high heat. Cook the pork chops in batches in the hot drippings until
evenly browned on both sides. Use additional bacon drippings for each batch as
needed. Remove the pork chops to a cutting board and blot excess fat off the
surface of the chops with a paper towel; cut into bite-sized cubes and stir
into the bacon mixture.

Heat a small amount of the bacon drippings in the skillet; cook and stir the
bell pepper in the hot drippings until softened and fragrant; drain on a plate
lined with paper towels. Stir the cooked pepper into the bacon mixture.

Pour the tomatoes with liquid and beef broth into a stockpot and place the pot
over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook
until the stew begins to thicken, stirring occasionally, about 90 minutes.
Stir the sour cream into the stew just before serving.

Bring a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a rolling boil; add the egg
noodles to the water and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Ladle the
stew over the drained noodles to serve.
