spicy-noodles---malay-style

Steps

Bring a large pot of water to a boil, cook the egg noodles 6 to 8 minutes,
until al dente, and drain.

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the garlic about 1
minute. Stir in the spinach, and cook about 1 minute. Mix in the cooked egg
noodles, chile paste, and ketchup, and toss until well coated.

Make a hole in the center of the noodle mixture. Place the egg in the center,
and scramble, tossing with the noodles just before egg is finished cooking.

Mix the sugar and enough water to keep the mixture moist into the skillet.
Season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, about 6
minutes. Toss in the sprouts and peas, and cook and stir about 4 minutes,
until heated through.
