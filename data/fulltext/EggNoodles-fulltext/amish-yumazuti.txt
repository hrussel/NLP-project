Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place noodles in a pot of
lightly salted boiling water. Cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and
set aside.

Cook ground beef, onion, celery and garlic in a skillet over medium heat until
meat is evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.

Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place half of the cooked noodles in the bottom
of the dish. Cover them with half of the meat mixture, then half of the
tomatoes. Spoon half of the cream of chicken soup over the tomatoes, then
sprinkle half of the shredded cheese. Repeat layers, ending with cheese on the
top.

Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until cheese is browned and bubbly.
Let stand for 10 minutes to set before serving.
