Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square
pan.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.

Beat cream cheese and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer
until smooth and creamy; beat in cottage cheese, egg, egg whites, vanilla
extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg until well combined. Fold noodles and apples
into cheese mixture by hand; spread into the prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until kugel is lightly browned and firm, 45 to 50
minutes.
