Steps

In a small saucepan, boil or steam asparagus in enough water to cover until
tender; chop and set aside.

Bring a large pot of salted water to full boil, place the pasta in the pot and
return to a rolling boil; cook until al dente. Drain well.

In a large saucepan, saute garlic in the olive oil over medium-low heat until
the garlic is golden brown.

Place butter and lemon juice in the saucepan. Heat until the butter has
melted. Place the shrimp in the saucepan and cook until the shrimp turns pink.
Place the mushrooms and asparagus into the saucepan, cook until mushrooms are
tender.

Toss the shrimp and vegetable mixture with the egg noodles and sprinkle with
Parmesan cheese. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
