Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling
water until al dente, adding peas for the final 3 minutes of cooking; drain.

Melt the butter in the same pot over medium heat. Add the mushroom soup, tuna,
milk, and Cheddar cheese. Stir until cheese is melted, and the mixture is
smooth. Stir in the pasta and peas until evenly coated.
