Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly
salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al
dente; drain.

In a skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no pink shows;
drain excess fat. Stir in tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and
oregano; set aside.

In a separate skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Saute the
chopped onion until translucent. In a medium bowl, combine cottage cheese,
cream cheese, sour cream and sauteed onions.

Place 1/2 of cooked noodles in the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish. Drizzle
with 1/2 of the melted butter. Cover with cheese mixture. Toss remaining
noodles with remaining melted butter, and spread over cheese mixture. Cover
with meat mixture.

Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until bubbly.
