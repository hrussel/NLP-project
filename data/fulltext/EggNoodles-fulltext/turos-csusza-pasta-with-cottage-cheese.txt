Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until
al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain well.

Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp; drain, crumble,
and set aside.

Place the drained noodles in a large baking dish. Stir the sour cream into the
noodles. Spoon the cottage cheese evenly over the top of the noodle mixture.
Sprinkle the crumbled bacon over the top; season with salt.

Bake in preheated oven until the cottage cheese softens, 3 to 5 minutes.
