noodles-marmaduke

Steps

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic
and mushrooms; cook and stir until lightly browned. Crumble in the ground
beef, and cook until no longer pink. Drain excess grease.

Stir in the Burgundy wine, scraping any bits of food from the bottom of the
pan to flavor the sauce. Then stir in the lemon juice, beef consomme, salt and
pepper. Simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.

Mix the uncooked noodles into the skillet. Cover, and simmer for 10 minutes,
or until noodles are tender. Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream.
Sprinkle parsley over the top and serve.
