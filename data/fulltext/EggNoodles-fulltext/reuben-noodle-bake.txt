Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8
to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Toss with half the melted butter and
place in a 9x13 baking dish.

Spread sauerkraut over the noodles; cover evenly with corned beef. Spread
mayonnaise over beef and top with the shredded Swiss and tomato slices.
