tuna-noodle-asparagus-casserole

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes; drain.

Stir noodles, tuna, black olives, and cream of mushroom soup together in the
bottom of a casserole dish. Add 2/3 cup Cheddar cheese, hot pepper sauce, and
black pepper to the noodle mixture; mix. Gently fold asparagus into the noodle
mixture. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese over the dish.

Bake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
