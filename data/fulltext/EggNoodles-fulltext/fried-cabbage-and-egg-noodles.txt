fried-cabbage-and-egg-noodles

Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the egg noodles in
the boiling water until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 5
minutes. Drain.

While the noodles cook, melt the butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add
the cabbage to the melted butter; season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook
until the cabbage begins to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the drained noodles
into the cabbage; cook and stir until the noodles begin to brown, about 5
minutes.
