Steps

In a large pot with boiling salted water cook egg noodles until al dente.
Drain.

In a large skillet over medium heat oil. Add sliced mushrooms, green bell
pepper, onion, and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in ground beef and brown; drain
excess grease. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, parsley, Italian seasoning, dried
oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, ground black pepper and sugar. Cover and simmer
for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally.

In a small bowl combine cream cheese, sour cream, finely chopped green onion,

To assemble, in a greased 2 quart casserole dish layer egg noodles. Spread
tomato mixture over noodles, followed by the cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle
