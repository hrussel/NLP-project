Steps

Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until
evenly brown. Stir in crushed garlic, salt, sugar and tomato sauce; cover and
simmer for 15 to 20 minutes

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for
8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a small bowl combine green onions, cream cheese and sour cream. In a 9x13
inch baking dish, place 1/3 of the noodles, cheese mixture, and tomato sauce;
repeat twice. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top of the casserole.

Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until bubbly; serve.
