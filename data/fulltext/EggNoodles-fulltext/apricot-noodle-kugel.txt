Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch
baking pan.

Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in egg noodles,
and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix egg noodles with 1/4 cup butter, cream
cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla. Stir in apricot nectar and milk. Mix
in raisins. Transfer to the prepared baking pan.

In a separate medium bowl, mix cornflake crumbs, 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup
sugar, remaining vanilla, and cinnamon. Spread over the egg noodle mixture.

Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.
