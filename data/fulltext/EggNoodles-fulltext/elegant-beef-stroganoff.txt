Steps

Mix steak and red wine together in a bowl; set aside to marinate for 15 to 30
minutes.

Combine flour, salt, paprika, and black pepper together in a resealable
plastic bag. Remove steak from marinade, reserving red wine for later use; add
steak to flour mixture and shake to coat.

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir steak,
onion, and garlic until steak is browned and onion is softened and
translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.

Stir mushrooms, beef broth, water, reserved red wine marinade, Worcestershire
sauce, red pepper flakes, and mustard into steak mixture until well mixed;
bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and simmer until steak is very
tender, about 1 hour.

Stir cream cheese and sour cream into steak mixture; cook and stir until
warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve over cooked noodles.
