Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook
for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and return to the pot.

Heat the olive oil in a skillet, and cook the garlic and spinach 3 to 5
minutes, until well coated. Transfer to the pot with the drained pasta. Toss
in the cottage cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
