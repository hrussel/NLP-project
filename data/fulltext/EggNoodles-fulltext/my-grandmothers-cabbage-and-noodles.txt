Steps

Place water and butter in a large, deep skillet and bring to a boil; stir in
bacon and return to a boil.

Stir cabbage into the bacon mixture; simmer until the thickest pieces of
cabbage are fork-tender and the liquid has almost evaporated, about 20
minutes. Drain.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir
in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain
well.

Lightly toss egg noodles with bacon and cabbage; season to taste with salt and
black pepper.
