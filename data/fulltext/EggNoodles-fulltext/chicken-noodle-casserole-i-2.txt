chicken-noodle-casserole-i-2

Steps

Poach chicken in a large pot of simmering water. Cook until no longer pink in
center, about 12 minutes. Remove from pot and set aside. Bring chicken cooking
water to a boil and cook pasta in it. Drain. Cut chicken into small pieces,
and mix with noodles.

In a separate bowl, mix together mushroom soup, chicken soup, and sour cream.
Season with salt and pepper. Gently stir together cream soup mixture with the
chicken mixture. Place in a 2 quart baking dish.

Melt butter in a small saucepan, and remove from heat. Stir in crumbled
crackers. Top casserole with the buttery crackers.

Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, until heated
through and browned on top.
