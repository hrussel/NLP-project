Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

In a 13x9 inch casserole dish, combine the mushroom and beef onion soups,
canned mushrooms and water. Mix thoroughly and add beef tips. Turn to coat
well.

Bake in a preheated oven for 1 hour.

While beef tips are baking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Serve
beef tips and sauce over noodles.
