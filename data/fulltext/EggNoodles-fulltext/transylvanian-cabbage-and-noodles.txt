transylvanian-cabbage-and-noodles

Steps

Place shredded cabbage in a bowl; sprinkle with salt and toss to combine.
Allow cabbage to stand for 30 minutes; squeeze cabbage dry and discard juice.

Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir cabbage and
onion until cabbage is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Season to taste with
salt and black pepper.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir
in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain
well.

Lightly mix egg noodles into the cabbage mixture; season with salt and black
pepper if needed and sprinkle with caraway seeds.
