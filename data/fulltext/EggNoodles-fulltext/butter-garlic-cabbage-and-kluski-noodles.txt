butter-garlic-cabbage-and-kluski-noodles

Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir
in kluski noodles and return to a boil. Cook kluski noodles uncovered,
stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, 7 to 10 minutes.
Drain well. Return to pot and stir in 3 tablespoons butter until butter has
melted and coated the noodles. Set noodles aside.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir sweet
onion in butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir
until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Thoroughly mix in crushed red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning. Stir
cabbage and water into onion mixture until well combined. Cover and cook,
stirring often, until cabbage is tender and reduced in volume by about half,
15 to 20 minutes. There should be a small amount of liquid left in pot.

Gently stir the buttered kluski noodles into the cabbage mixture until well
combined. For a more buttery flavor, stir in 3 more tablespoons butter if
desired; season to taste with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder.
