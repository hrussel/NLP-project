fried-cabbage-and-noodles

Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir
in kluski noodles and return to a boil. Cook kluski noodles uncovered,
stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, 7 to 10 minutes.
Drain well and set noodles aside.

Place chopped bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat,
stirring often, until evenly browned, 5 to 8 minutes.

Cook and stir cabbage and onion into the bacon and drippings until the cabbage
is wilted and tender, about 10 minutes.

Gently mix the cooked kluski noodles into cabbage mixture; season with hot
sauce.

Ingredients

1 (8 ounce) package kluski noodles

1 pound bacon, chopped

1 head cabbage, chopped

1 onion, chopped
