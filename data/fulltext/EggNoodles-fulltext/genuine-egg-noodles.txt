Steps

Combine flour, salt and baking powder. Mix in eggs and enough water to make
the dough workable. Knead dough until stiff. Roll into ball and cut into
quarters. Using 1/4 of the dough at a time, roll flat to about 1/8 inch use
flour as needed, top and bottom, to prevent sticking. Peel up and roll from
one end to the other. Cut roll into 3/8 inch strips. Noodles should be about 4
to 5 inches long depending on how thin it was originally flattened. Let dry
for 1 to 3 hours.

Cook like any pasta or, instead of drying first cook it fresh but make sure
water is boiling and do not allow to stick. It takes practice to do this
right.
