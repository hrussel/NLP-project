jerk-chicken-and-pasta

Steps

Rub each breast half with 1/2 teaspoon jerk paste, and place in a shallow
dish. Cover, and refrigerate at least 1 hour.

Preheat the grill for high heat. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to
a boil, cook the egg noodles 6 to 8 minutes, until al dente, and drain.

Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken 8 to 10 minutes on each side, until
juices run clear.

Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook
the garlic for one minute. Mix in the chicken stock, 1 tablespoon jerk paste,
white wine, chopped cilantro, juice of 1 lime, salt, and pepper. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat to low, and stir in the heavy cream. Cook and stir until
mixture is thickened, about 5 minutes. Do not allow it to boil.

Pour the cooked egg noodles into the saucepan, and toss with the cream sauce.
Divide noodles onto 4 serving plates, and top with grilled chicken. Garnish
each serving with a cilantro sprig and the juice of 1/4 lime.
