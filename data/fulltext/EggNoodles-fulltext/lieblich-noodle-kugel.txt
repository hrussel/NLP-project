Steps

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan
with cooking spray. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles, and
cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain.

Combine the cottage cheese, pineapple, and apples; set aside. Mix together the
sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, and set aside.

Spread one-third of the noodles onto the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread
with half of the cottage cheese mixture, and sprinkle with one-third of the
cinnamon sugar. Layer with another third of the noodles, and the remaining
cottage cheese. Sprinkle with another third of the cinnamon sugar and the
remaining noodles. Mix together the white wine and melted butter; brush onto
the noodles. Sprinkle with remaining cinnamon sugar. Cover with aluminum foil.

Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until apples are tender.
