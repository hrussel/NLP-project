Steps

Season the chicken with the garlic powder and paprika. Cook the chicken in a
12 inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned on both
sides.

Add the stock, basil, black pepper and vegetables to the skillet and heat to a
boil. Stir in the noodles. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10
minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the noodles are tender.
