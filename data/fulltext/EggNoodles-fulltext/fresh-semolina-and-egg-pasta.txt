Steps

Thoroughly sift together all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and pinch of salt.
On a clean surface, make a mountain out of flour mixture then make a deep well
in center. Break the eggs into the well and add olive oil. Whisk eggs very
gently with a fork, gradually incorporating flour from the sides of the well.
When mixture becomes too thick to mix with a fork, begin kneading with your
hands.

Knead dough for 8 to 12 minutes, until it is smooth and supple. Dust dough and
work surface with semolina as needed to keep dough from becoming sticky. Wrap
dough tightly in plastic and allow it to rest at room temperature for 30
minutes.

Roll out dough with a pasta machine or a rolling pin to desired thickness. Cut
into your favorite style of noodle or stuff with your favorite filling to make
ravioli. Bring water to a boil in a large pot, then add 4 teaspoons salt. Cook
pasta until tender but not mushy, 1 to 8 minutes depending on thickness. Drain
immediately and toss with your favorite sauce.
