Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Brown the ground beef in a large skillet over medium high heat. Stir in the
tomato soup, Worcestershire sauce and garlic, bring to a boil, reduce heat to
low and let simmer.

When noodles are done, stir them and the cheese into the simmering sauce until
cheese is melted. Stir the sherry into the sauce and stir for 1 minute, then
place in a 2 quart casserole dish and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese to
taste.
