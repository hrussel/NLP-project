Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish
with cooking spray.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.

Gently stir egg noodles, sour cream, cottage cheese, pineapple with juice,
eggs, orange juice, cranberries, melted butter, sugar, applesauce, orange
zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until thoroughly
combined. Spoon the noodle mixture into prepared baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until kugel is set and browned on top, 60 to 75
minutes.
