tuna-noodle-casserole-i-2

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 2 quart casserole dish
with cooking spray.

In a large pot of salted water, boil noodles until al dente. Drain well.

In a medium saucepan, combine flour, butter, and salt. Stir until butter is
melted and ingredients are combined evenly. Add milk, and whisk until the
sauce thickens (usually it is at the proper consistency by the time it begins
to boil). Add cheese to mixture, and whisk until cheese is melted and mixture
is well blended. Stir in tuna, peas, and noodles. Spread evenly in prepared
dish.

Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
