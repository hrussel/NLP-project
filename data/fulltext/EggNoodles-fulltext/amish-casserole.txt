Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook
until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain and return to the pan. Mix in the cream
of chicken soup until noodles are coated.

Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain the
grease, and stir in the tomato soup, brown sugar, pepper and salt. Spread half
of the beef in the bottom of a greased 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. Arrange 5
slices of cheese over the beef. Top with half of the noodles, then repeat
layers ending with cheese on top.

Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is browned and sauce
is bubbly.
