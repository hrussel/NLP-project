quick-cabbage-and-noodles

Steps

Cook and stir ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat until
ground beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.

Cook and stir cabbage into ground beef mixture until cabbage is just tender,
about 5 minutes.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir
in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain
well.

Stir noodles and cream of mushroom soup into the beef and cabbage until heated
through; season with salt and black pepper.
