Steps

Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook
in batches until it's well browned, stirring often. Add the onion, garlic,
parsley and mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are tender. Remove the beef
mixture from the skillet. Stir the broth and wine in the skillet and heat to a
boil. Reduce the heat to medium.

Stir the sour cream and flour in a small bowl. Add the sour cream mixture to
the skillet. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Return the
beef mixture to the skillet and cook until hot. Serve over the noodles with
the black pepper, if desired.
