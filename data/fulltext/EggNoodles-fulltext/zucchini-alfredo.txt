Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook
for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic, and cook 2
minutes. Mix in zucchini, and cook 10 minutes, until some of the moisture has
evaporated.

Pour the milk into the skillet, and stir in cream cheese until melted. Mix in
basil. Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Serve
over the cooked pasta.
