Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish
with cooking spray. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain.

In a large bowl, mix together margarine, sour cream, egg substitute, sugar,
lemon juice, vanilla extract, and applesauce. Stir in noodles and raisins.

Spread graham cracker crumbs on the bottom of the prepared dish. Pour the
noodle mixture over the crumbs. Sprinkle top with cinnamon.

Bake 45 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until set. Cover with foil if
it browns too quickly.
