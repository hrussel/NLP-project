Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook beef in hot skillet, stirring
occasionally, until some of the fat from the meat renders, 1 to 2 minutes; add
onion and saute the mixture until the beef is completely browned, about 5
minutes more.

Pour water into the skillet; add beef bouillon. Reduce heat to low and cook
mixture at a simmer until the liquid is mostly evaporated, about 90 minutes.

Stir cream of mushroom soup into the beef mixture; continue cooking until
heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Divide noodles between 4 plates and spoon beef
mixture over the noodles.
