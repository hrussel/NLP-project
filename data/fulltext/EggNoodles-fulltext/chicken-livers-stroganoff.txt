Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles, and cook
until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, and set aside.

While the noodles are getting started, heat olive oil in a large heavy
skillet. Add onions, and cook, stirring until tender, about 5 minutes. Add
mushrooms, and continue cooking for a few minutes, until starting to brown.
Add the chicken livers, and season with paprika, salt and pepper. Cook for 8
to 10 minutes, until livers are nicely browned on the outside, but still
slightly pink in the center. Do not over cook - the livers will become tough
and leathery.

Remove the skillet from the heat, and gradually whisk in the sherry, then the
sour cream until well blended. Serve over hot egg noodles.
