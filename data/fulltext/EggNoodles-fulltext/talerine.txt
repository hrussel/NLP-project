Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, saute the ground beef and the onion
together for about 5 minutes, or until the meat is browned and crumbly. Stir
in the tomato paste, stewed tomatoes with juice, salt and ground black pepper.

Add the uncooked egg noodles to this mixture and pour in water to cover. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat to low and let simmer until the noodles are slightly
softened, about 5 minutes. Drain excess water, stir in the corn and transfer
mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with cheese.

Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
