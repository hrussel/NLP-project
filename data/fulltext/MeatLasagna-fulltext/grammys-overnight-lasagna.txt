Steps

Cook the ground beef in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until browned
and no longer pink, about 5 minutes; drain fat. Stir in the marinara sauce,
water, and salt. Bring to a boil. Remove sauce from heat.

Arrange 6 noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking if necessary to fit.
Spoon 1/2 of the sauce over noodles. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese and
1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers with remaining noodles, sauce,
cottage cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover tightly
with foil; refrigerate overnight.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bake lasagna, covered, until noodles are soft, cheese is melted, and sauce is
bubbly, about 1 hour. Allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.
