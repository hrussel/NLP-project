Steps

Remove sausage meat from casings and crumble into large deep pot. Place pot
over medium-high heat and cook breaking up meat with a spoon for about 5 min
or until no longer pink. With a slotted spoon, transfer meat into a bowl;
discarding any fat left in the pot.

Return pot to medium-high heat and add butter, mushrooms, zucchini and Italian
seasoning. Cook, stirring for about 8 min or until no liquid remains from
mushroom mixture. Return meat with any accumulated juices to pot and add
tomatoes.

Whisk flour into cream and add to pot along with the water and pasta. Increase
heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring
occasionally for about 10 min or until pasta is tender but firm. Season to
taste with salt (if using).

Divide cheese among soup bowls and ladle soup over top to melt cheese.
