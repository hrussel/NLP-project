Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through, about 8
minutes. Drain and pat noodles dry with paper towels.

Brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking the
meat into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Pour pasta sauce into beef
mixture and stir garlic powder, basil, parsley, chives, oregano, and nutmeg
into beef and sauce.

Spread half of the beef sauce into a 2-quart casserole dish and sprinkle with
1 cup Cheddar cheese.

Lay a lasagna noodle out onto a lightly floured work surface and spread with 2
tablespoons cream cheese. Spread 2 tablespoons ground beef sauce onto noodle;
roll noodle and place with seam side down atop cheese in casserole dish.
Repeat with remaining noodles. Sprinkle remaining beef sauce and 1 cup Cheddar
cheese over noodle rolls.

Bake in the preheated oven until cheese and sauce bubble, 10 to 15 minutes.
