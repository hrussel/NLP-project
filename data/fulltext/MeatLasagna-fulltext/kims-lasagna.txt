Steps

Brown sausage and ground beef with onion and garlic in a large Dutch oven or
heavy pot over medium heat, cooking and stirring until meat is cooked through,
10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, crushed
tomatoes, Italian-style crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, 2 tablespoons
parsley, brown sugar, salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper, fennel seeds, and
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into meat mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to
low, and simmer sauce for at least 1 hour (up to 6 for best flavor). Stir
occasionally.

Place lasagna noodles into a deep bowl and cover with very hot tap water; let
soak for 30 minutes.

Beat egg in a bowl and stir ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2
teaspoon salt, and nutmeg into egg until thoroughly combined.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 cup sauce. Layer 4 soaked
lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1/3 of the shredded
mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the dish. Repeat layers
twice more, ending with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Cover dish with
aluminum foil.

Bake until lasagna noodles are tender and casserole is bubbling, about 50
minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese topping is lightly browned, 15 to
20 more minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
