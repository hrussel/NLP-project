Steps

In a large pot cook lasagna noodles in boiling salted water until al dente.
Rinse with cool water. Drain.

In large sauce pan cook ground beef. Drain excess grease. Combine tomato
sauces and tomato paste with ground beef and simmer until bubbly. Add garlic
salt and Italian seasoning and reduce heat to low simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.

To assemble, in the bottom of a 13x9 inch baking dish spread a thin layer of
sauce. Next, add a layer of noodles, ricotta cheese, sauce/ground beef
mixture, and then grated mozzarella cheese. Repeat until baking dish is
filled. Garnish top with additional shredded mozzarella cheese.

In a preheated 375 degree F(190 degree C) oven bake for 30 minutes or until
bubbly. Let stand for 15 minutes and serve.
