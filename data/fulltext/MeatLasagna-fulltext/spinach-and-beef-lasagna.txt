spinach-and-beef-lasagna

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Heat a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot pot
with garlic, oregano, and basil until beef is completely browned, 5 to 10
minutes. Stir spaghetti sauce and spinach into ground beef mixture; simmer
until heated through, about 5 minutes.

Stir ricotta cheese, 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, parsley, Parmesan cheese,
salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.

Spread a small amount of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Arrange
lasagna noodles in a single layer over the sauce. Spread another layer of
sauce over the top and arrange another layer of lasagna noodles over sauce.
Spread 1/2 the remaining sauce and 1/2 the cheese mixture over the top. Repeat
layers, finishing with sauce. Cover pan with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 55 minutes, remove aluminum foil, sprinkle
lasagna with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, and bake until noodles are cooked
through and sauce is bubbling, about 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before
serving.
