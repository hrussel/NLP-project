Steps

In a large skillet over medium heat brown the ground beef. Drain the grease.
Add spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.

In a large bowl, mix together the cottage cheese, 2 cups of the mozzarella
cheese, eggs, half of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt and
ground black pepper.

To assemble, in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish evenly spread 3/4 cup of
the sauce mixture. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cup of the
cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce. Repeat layers twice. Top with 3 noodles,
remaining sauce, remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Add 1/2 cup water
to the edges of the pan. Cover with aluminum foil.

Bake in a preheated 350 degree F(175 degrees C) oven for 45 minutes. Uncover
and bake an additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
