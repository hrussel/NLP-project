eggplant-and-ground-beef-lasagna

Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Grease the bottom and sides of 9x13 inch baking dish.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the lasagna
noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain
and set aside.

Cook and stir ground beef, onion, mushrooms, and garlic in a skillet over
medium heat until the beef is completely browned, about 10 minutes.

Stir canned tomatoes into ground beef; simmer until sauce has formed, 3 to 4
minutes.

Pour about one-fourth of the sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking
dish.

Layer noodles on top of sauce.

Spread a thin layer of sauce on top of noodles.

Place a layer of eggplant slices on top of noodle and sauce layer.

Sprinkle about one-fourth of the cheese on top of eggplant slices.

Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, until ending with a layer of sauce
topped with remaining cheese.

Bake in preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and brown on top, about 40
minutes.
