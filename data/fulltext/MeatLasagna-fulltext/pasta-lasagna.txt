pasta-lasagna

Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 1/2 quart baking
dish.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8
to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

In a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef until brown; drain. Stir in
pasta sauce; remove from heat.

In a bowl, combine ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella, Parmesan and beaten egg. Stir
until well combined.

In the prepared dish layer half the pasta, half the sauce and half the cheese
mixture. Repeat. Top with remaining mozzarella.

Bake in preheated oven 34 to 40 minutes, until hot and bubbly.
