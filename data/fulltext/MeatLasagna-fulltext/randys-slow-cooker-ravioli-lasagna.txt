Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, garlic, garlic
powder, salt, and pepper in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly,
5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir pasta sauce, Italian seasoning,
basil, and oregano into ground beef mixture.

Ladle a generous layer of meat sauce into the bottom of a slow cooker; add a
layer of ravioli. Ladle another layer of meat sauce over ravioli layer;
alternate with remaining ravioli and meat sauce until all ingredients are
used.

Cook on Low for 3 to 5 hours. Sprinkle ravioli mixture with mozzarella cheese
and continue cooking until cheese is melted, 45 minutes to 1 hour more.
