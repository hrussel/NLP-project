Steps

Cook and stir ground beef, onion, garlic powder, and oregano in a large
skillet over medium heat until onion is tender and beef is browned, about 10
minutes. Add tomato sauce and sugar; simmer until sauce is heated through,
about 10 minutes.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the
boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the
bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole
dish.

Mix ricotta cheese, egg, parsley, and 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese together in a
bowl.

Place a lasagna noodle on a work surface. Spoon one layer of ricotta cheese
mixture, one layer meat sauce, and one layer mozzarella cheese atop the
lasagna noodle; top with another lasagna noodle. Roll up the stuffed lasagna
noodles in the jelly-roll style; place in the prepared casserole dish. Repeat
with remaining lasagna noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, meat sauce, and
mozzarella cheese. Spread a spoonful of meat sauce atop each lasagna roll; top
with remaining mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, 30 to 35
minutes.
