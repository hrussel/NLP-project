louises-lasagna

Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Crumble ground beef into skillet; add
salami, pepperoni, and onion. Cook and stir mixture until beef is completely
browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain grease from skillet. Transfer meat mixture to
a slow cooker; stir stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, garlic
powder, oregano, salt, and pepper into the meat mixture.

Cook mixture in slow cooker on Low for 2 hours.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes;
drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Spread a thin layer of the sauce from the meat mixture into the bottom of a
baking dish. Layer about 1/3 of the noodles into the bottom of the dish; top
with about 1 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese, 2/3 cup cottage cheese, 3 slices white
American cheese, and 4 teaspoons grated parmesan cheese. Spread about 1/3 of
the meat mixture over the cheese layer. Repeat layers twice more.

Bake in preheated oven until the cheese melts throughout the lasagna, about 30
minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before cutting to serve.
