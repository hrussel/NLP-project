Steps

In a skillet over medium heat, brown ground beef, onion and garlic; drain fat.
Mix in basil, oregano, brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, diced tomatoes and
tomato paste. Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly
salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles, and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or
until al dente; drain. Lay noodles flat on towels, and blot dry.

In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, ricotta, Parmesan cheese, parsley and 1
teaspoon salt.

Layer 1/3 of the lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Cover noodles with 1/2 ricotta mixture, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/3
of the sauce. Repeat. Top with remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle
additional Parmesan cheese over the top.

Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
