Steps

Cook meat in a large skillet over medium-high heat until brown, stirring
occasionally with a wooden spoon and breaking up the meat. Remove skillet from
heat. Place colander over bowl. Spoon meat into colander and let fat drain
into bowl. Return meat to skillet. Discard fat.

Spoon 1 cup of Classico® Four Cheese pasta sauce in the bottom of a 2-quart
rectangular baking dish. Stir remaining Classico® Four Cheese pasta sauce into
meat in skillet. Cook over medium heat until hot, stirring occasionally with a
wooden spoon. Remove meat mixture from heat.

Place 2 uncooked noodles on sauce in bottom of dish. Spread one-third of the
meat mixture on top of noodles. Spread 3/4 cup of the cottage cheese over
meat. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese over cottage cheese. Add
another layer of 2 uncooked noodles, one-third of the meat mixture, the rest
of the cottage cheese, and 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese. Layer remaining
uncooked noodles, meat mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Finally, sprinkle
Parmesan cheese over top, if you like.

Cover baking dish with foil. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 1 hour. Remove
from oven and let stand on a cooling rack with foil cover in place for 15
minutes. Carefully remove foil from dish so steam escapes away from you. Makes
6 servings.
