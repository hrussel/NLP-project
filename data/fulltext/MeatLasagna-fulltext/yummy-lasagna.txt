Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8
to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

In large skillet over medium-high heat, cook beef until brown; drain. In small
saucepan, heat spaghetti sauce.

In a medium bowl, stir together ricotta, Romano, egg, basil and garlic.

Coat the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking dish with a thin layer of spaghetti sauce.
Place 3 or 4 noodles, overlapping edges, over sauce. Spread half of ricotta
mixture over noodles. Cover ricotta with half of browned beef, half of
pepperoni slices, and 1/4 of mozzarella cheese. Repeat sauce, noodle, ricotta,
meat and cheese layers. Layer sauce and noodles again, and pour remaining
sauce over all, being sure to cover the edges. Top with remaining mozzarella.

Cover pan with foil and pierce foil 3 or 4 times with fork to ventilate. Bake
45 minutes, remove foil, and bake 15 minutes more to brown the top. Let stand
10 minutes before serving.
