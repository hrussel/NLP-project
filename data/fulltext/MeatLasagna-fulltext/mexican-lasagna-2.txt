Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef, and stir in
the taco seasoning and tomatoes. Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with half the
tortillas. Spoon the beef mixture into the dish, then top with the remaining
tortillas. Spread salsa over the tortillas and sprinkle with the cheese.

Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is
melted and bubbly.
