Steps

Soak eggplant slices in a large bowl of lightly salted water for 30 minutes.
Drain and pat dry with paper towels.

Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 7
minutes. Remove from heat.

Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat
source.

Whisk olive oil and Italian seasoning together in a bowl.

Brush both sides of eggplant slices with the seasoned olive oil.

Arrange eggplant slices on a baking sheet and place in preheated oven; broil
until browned, 2 to 4 minutes on each side.

Set oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Measure 1 cup of Parmesan cheese and set aside.

Stir ricotta cheese, egg, and remaining Parmesan cheese together in a bowl.

Stir spaghetti sauce, diced tomatoes, and ketchup together in a separate bowl.

Spread a small amount of spaghetti sauce mixture in the bottom of a casserole
dish.

Top spaghetti sauce mixture with a layer of broiled eggplant slices.

Cover eggplant layer with a layer of the ricotta mixture.

Sprinkle a layer of feta on top of the ricotta mixture.

Cover feta layer with ground beef layer.

Sprinkle a layer of spinach on top of ground beef.

Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with a final layer of eggplant
topped with the reserved 1 cup Parmesan cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and cheese is browned,
about 40 minutes.

Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
