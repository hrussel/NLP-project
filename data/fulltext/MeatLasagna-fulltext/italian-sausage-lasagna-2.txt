Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of water and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to
the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in Italian sausage. Cook
and stir until sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about
10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Add diced tomatoes, tomato
sauce, 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon Greek seasoning, 1
tablespoon oregano, 1 tablespoon basil, 1 tablespoon parsley, 1 tablespoon
thyme, 1 teaspoon rosemary, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon salt;
stir well. Simmer until flavors have blended, about 20 minutes.

Set aside 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Mix remaining mozzarella cheese with 1
teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon Greek seasoning, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1
teaspoon basil, 1 teaspoon parsley, 1 teaspoon thyme, and 1 teaspoon rosemary
in a large bowl.

Spoon a layer of meat sauce into the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass baking dish;
place 3 to 4 lasagna noodles atop meat sauce layer. Spread another layer of
meat sauce over lasagna noodles; sprinkle a layer of the seasoned mozzarella
cheese. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients and top casserole with the
reserved 1/2 cup plain mozzarella cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and cheese is melted, 30 to
40 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
