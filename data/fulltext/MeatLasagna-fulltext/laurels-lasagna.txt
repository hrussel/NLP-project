Steps

In a large stock pot, cook the ground beef, ground pork, and chopped onions
until browned. Drain grease well.

Using the same stock pot, stir in the chopped mushrooms, whole tomatoes,
tomato paste, oregano flakes, garlic cloves, bay leaves, dried basil, parsley
flakes, salt and pepper to taste, and sugar. Simmer over low heat for one
hour.

In a large pot, cook lasagna noodles in boiling salted water until al dente.
Rinse with cool water, and drain well.

In a separate bowl, combine cottage or ricotta cheese, eggs, and grated
Parmesan cheese.

Mix grated Colby and mozzarella cheeses together in a medium bowl.

In each 13x9 inch casserole dish layer 1/2 cup meat sauce, then noodles,
Parmesan-egg mixture, and grated Colby-mozzarella cheese. Repeat until all
ingredients are used up.

Bake in a preheated 375 degree F (190 degree C) oven for one hour and 45
minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
