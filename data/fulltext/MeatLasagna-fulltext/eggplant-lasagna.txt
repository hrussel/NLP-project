eggplant-lasagna

Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Oil two baking sheets with 1
teaspoon olive oil.

Whisk eggs and water together in a shallow dish.

Combine Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, salt, and ground black pepper in a
separate shallow dish.

Dip eggplant slices in egg mixture.

Press slices into the crumbs and tap off excess. Arrange slices on the
prepared baking sheets.

Bake eggplant slices in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 20 to
25 minutes. Flip eggplant and bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes.

Remove eggplant from the oven and increase temperature to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C).

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and stir in
ground beef. Season beef with salt and ground black pepper.

Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about
10 minutes. Drain excess grease.

Stir tomato sauce into ground beef; bring to a simmer and set sauce aside.

Oil a 9x13 baking dish with olive oil.

Place 1/3 of the eggplant slices on bottom of the dish.

Pour 1/3 of tomato sauce with ground beef on top of eggplant layer.

Sprinkle 1/3 of mozzarella cheese on top of sauce layer.

Repeat 2 more times, finishing with a layer of mozzarella cheese.

Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is
bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.

Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
