Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a large disposable
aluminum roasting pan with cooking spray.

Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking the meat into
crumbles as it browns, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain excess grease and stir in taco
seasoning and half the enchilada sauce. Reserve remaining enchilada sauce for
later use. Bring beef mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until
thickened, about 5 minutes. Set meat aside.

Layer one package of tortillas into the bottom of the prepared aluminum
roasting pan and spread refried beans evenly in a layer over the tortillas.
Arrange 1 more package of halved tortillas over the beans, and top with slices
of queso fresco. Spread 1 package of reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend over
queso fresco slices. Lay half the sliced nopalitos in a criss-cross pattern
over the shredded cheese.

Top nopalito layer with 1 more package of tortillas and spread beef mixture
over the tortillas; top with remaining package of tortillas. Finish casserole
with remaining enchilada sauce and remaining 1 package cheese blend. Top the
cheese with remaining nopalito slices arranged in a criss-cross pattern.

Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and the cheese topping
is melted and starting to brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve in squares.
