Steps

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish
with cooking spray.

Place the sausage in a skillet over medium heat and cook until browned and
crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain the sausage and set aside.

To make bechamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and
whisk in the flour. Allow the flour and butter to cook until light and foamy,
about 2 minutes, whisking constantly; whisk in milk, a little at a time. Whisk
in the salt and nutmeg and bring the sauce to a bare simmer, whisking
constantly until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove sauce from the heat and
set aside.

In a bowl, beat the egg and stir in the ricotta cheese and parsley until
thoroughly combined.

To assemble lasagna, pour about 1 1/2 cup of marinara sauce into the bottom of
the prepared baking dish and top the sauce with 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping
if necessary. On the noodles, layer 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, followed by
1/3 of the cooked sausage, 1/3 cup of mushrooms, 1/4 of the bechamel sauce, 1
cup of the mozzarella cheese, 1/8 cup of the Parmesan cheese and 1 more cup of
marinara sauce. Repeat the layers twice more, ending with a final layer of
noodles topped with a layer of marinara sauce, bechamel sauce, the remaining
mozzarella cheese, and remaining Parmesan cheese. Cover the dish with foil.

Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and the noodles are tender, about 1
hour. Remove foil and bake until the top cheese layer is browned, about 5 more
minutes. Allow the lasagna to stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
