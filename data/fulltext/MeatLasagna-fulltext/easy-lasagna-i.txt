Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add mushrooms and
onions; saute until onions are transparent. Stir in pasta sauce, and heat
through.

In a medium size bowl, combine cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan
cheese, and eggs.

Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 13x9 inch pan. Layer
with uncooked lasagna noodles, cheese mixture, mozzarella cheese, and meat
sauce. Continue layering until all ingredients are used, reserving 1/2 cup
mozzarella. Cover pan with aluminum foil.

Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover, and top with remaining half
cup of mozzarella cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes. Remove from oven,
and let stand 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
