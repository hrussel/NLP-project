Steps

In a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef until brown. Drain. In another
skillet over medium heat, cook onion until translucent. Combine beef and onion
in a large saucepan with tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, water, oregano,
garlic powder, salt, pepper and sugar. Cook over medium heat until mixture
comes to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1 hour.

While sauce is simmering, blend cottage cheese, Parmesan and egg until smooth.
Set aside.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8
to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Spread 1 cup of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover sauce
with 3 noodles. Cover noodles with one-third of remaining sauce. Top with half
the mozzarella. Place another layer of noodles and one of sauce over the
mozzarella; top that with the cottage cheese mixture. Top with remaining 3
noodles and remaining sauce.

Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella on top and
bake 15 minutes more, until golden and bubbly.
