Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Heat oil in a large
saucepan or Dutch oven set over medium heat. Add onion, green pepper, garlic
and dried herbs; cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until vegetables soften.

Crumble in beef and pork and brown all over, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato
juice, chili sauce, tomato paste and Worcestershire Sauce; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.

Spread 1/4 of the sauce in to a 13- x 9-in (3 L) casserole dish. Top with 3
noodles. Layer with 1/4 more sauce and 1/3 of the cheese. Repeat layers twice,
ending with cheese.

Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour. Remove foil and bake for 15 minutes or
until golden. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
