Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook noodles in boiling
water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.

In a large skillet over medium heat, saute ground beef, onions, salt and
garlic salt until meat is brown. Drain excess fat, add spaghetti sauce to beef
mixture, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch glass baking
pan.

Line bottom of pan with three lasagna noodles. Spread 1/3 of sauce mixture
over noodles. Layer 1/3 of the cottage cheese over the sauce. Sprinkle 1/3 of
the mozzarella over the cottage cheese. Repeat this layering process until all
ingredients are used up.

Bake in the preheated oven for one hour. Let stand for 10 minutes before
serving.
