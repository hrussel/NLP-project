Steps

Cook and stir the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large pot or Dutch oven
over medium-high heat until lightly browned. Drain any excess grease, then
stir in the onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has
softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the chipotle
chile, tomato paste, and stewed tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat
to medium-low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and
pepper, then stir in the basil and oregano; simmer 5 minutes more then remove
from the heat.

While the sauce is simmering, stir together the cream cheese and chopped
spinach until blended. Leave the spinach soggy, the water will help thin out
the cream cheese to a sour cream-like consistency.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with a sheet of aluminum foil, and
lightly grease. Place 3 lasagna noodles on the bottom of the pan, and spread
with 1/3 of the spinach mixture. Spread 1/3 of the chipotle meat sauce over
this, then layer with 1/3 of the mozzarella and 1/3 of the zucchini. Sprinkle
with 1/3 of the Asiago cheese and 1/3 of the Parmesan cheeses. Repeat layers
two more times, ending with cheeses on top.

Cover the dish with aluminum foil, and bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes.
Uncover, and continue baking until the top is bubbly and golden brown, 15 to
20 minutes.
