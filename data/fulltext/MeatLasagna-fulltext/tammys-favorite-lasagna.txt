Steps

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until soft. Stir in
ground beef, and cook until evenly brown. Drain excess fat. Season with
Italian seasoning, rosemary, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes,
tomato paste and water. Simmer 1 hour, or until sauce has thickened.

Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion until soft and
translucent. Stir in flour until smooth. Stir in Parmesan cheese, then milk.
Cook, stirring, until thick. Allow to cool, then stir in egg. (Sauce will be
very thick.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly
salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al
dente; drain. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.

In prepared baking dish, place a layer of noodles, meat sauce, cheese sauce,
ricotta, and mozzarella. Repeat layers. Build to your desired thickness, or
make another smaller pan for freezing.

Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.
