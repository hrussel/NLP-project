Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles
and olive oil; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.

Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir
in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season
with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a
bowl.

Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the
bottom in a thin layer. Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna
noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture
and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese. Repeat
layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella
cheese.

Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before
serving.
