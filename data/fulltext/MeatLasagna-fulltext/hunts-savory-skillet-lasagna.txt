Steps

Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt.

Meanwhile, cook sausage in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until

tomatoes and tomato paste; mix well. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Transfer sausage mixture to medium bowl; set aside.

Drain pasta in colander. Place half of pasta in same skillet; top with half
each of the sausage mixture and cheese. Repeat all layers. Cover skillet with

cheese melts. Remove from heat; let stand 1 minute before serving.
