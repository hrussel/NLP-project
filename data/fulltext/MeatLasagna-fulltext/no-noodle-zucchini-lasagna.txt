Steps

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13 inch baking
pan.

Slice zucchini lengthwise into very thin slices. Sprinkle slices lightly with
salt; set aside to drain in a colander.

To prepare the meat sauce, cook and stir ground beef and black pepper in a
large skillet over medium high heat for 5 minutes. Add in green pepper and
onion; cook and stir until meat is no longer pink. Stir in tomato paste,
tomato sauce, wine, basil, and oregano, adding a small amount of hot water if
sauce is too thick. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer sauce for about 20
minutes, stirring frequently.

Meanwhile, stir egg, ricotta, and parsley together in a bowl until well
combined.

To assemble lasagna, spread 1/2 of the meat sauce into the bottom of prepared
pan. Then layer 1/2 the zucchini slices, 1/2 the ricotta mixture, all of the
spinach, followed by all of the mushrooms, then 1/2 the mozzarella cheese.
Repeat by layering the remaining meat sauce, zucchini slices, ricotta mixture,
and mozzarella. Spread Parmesan cheese evenly over the top; cover with foil.

Bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil; raise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C), and bake an additional 15 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before
serving.
