Steps

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir flour, salt, and
pepper into melted butter until flour is dissolved. Slowly whisk milk into
butter-flour mixture until a thick white sauce forms, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove
saucepan from heat.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot
skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Add spaghetti sauce and nutmeg to ground beef; cook until spaghetti sauce is
heated through, about 5 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Spread a layer of meat sauce into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover
meat sauce layer with a layer of lasagna noodles; top with 1/3 the white
sauce, 1/2 the remaining meat sauce, 1/3 the Mexican cheese blend, and 1/3 the
Parmesan cheese, respectively. Repeat 1 more layer of each ingredient; top
with 1 more layer lasagna noodles, remaining white sauce, Mexican cheese
blend, and Parmesan cheese. Pour water around the edges of the dish. Cover
dish with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue
baking until cheeses are melted, about 10 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 10
minutes before serving.
