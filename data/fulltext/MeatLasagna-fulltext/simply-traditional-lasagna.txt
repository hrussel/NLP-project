Steps

Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black olives, and season with
basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes.
Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce,
and remove from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over
the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese. Cover with another
layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on top.
Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.

Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes
depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can easily
stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return
to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese topping.
