Steps

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground lamb in the
hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard
grease. Add onion and garlic to lamb; cook and stir until onion is
translucent, 3 to 6 minutes.

Stir tomato paste, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into lamb
mixture; cook until spices are fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add water, lasagna
noodles, and balsamic vinegar to lamb mixture; bring to a boil. Cover skillet,
lower heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove cover and simmer until noodles
are tender yet firm to the bite and sauce is thickened, 5 to 7 more minutes.

Stir Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon mint, and salt together in a bowl. Spoon
yogurt mixture, about 2 tablespoons per addition, across top of lasagna
mixture. Sprinkle feta cheese over top and garnish with chopped mint leaves.
