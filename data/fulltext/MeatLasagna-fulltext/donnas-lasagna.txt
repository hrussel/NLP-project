Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling
water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.

Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook ground beef
and sausage over medium heat until brown; drain. Stir in tomato puree, tomato
paste, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, garlic, and 1 1/2 tablespoons parsley. Reduce
heat, and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.

In a bowl, stir together cottage cheese, eggs, pepper, Parmesan, 1 1/2
tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until blended.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish,
layer a third each of the noodles, sliced mozzarella, cottage cheese mixture,
and meat sauce. Repeat layers twice.

Bake lasagna in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until hot and bubbly. Let
stand 15 minutes before serving.
