Steps

Cook pasta according to package directions; drain.

Meanwhile, cook Johnsonville® Mild Italian Ground Sausage in a 10-inch
nonstick skillet until meat is brown; drain. Set meat aside. Wipe skillet with
paper towel.

Spread about half of the cooked pasta in the skillet. Cover with about half of
the Classico® Tomato and Basil pasta sauce. Spoon cooked meat over Classico®
Tomato and Basil pasta sauce. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese.
Top with remaining pasta and sauce. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
cheese over top.

Cook, covered, over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through and
cheese melts. Remove skillet from heat and let stand, covered, for 1 minute.
