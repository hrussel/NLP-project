Steps

Over medium-high heat, bring a medium pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add
chicken, celery, a slice of the onion, and garlic. Reduce heat to medium and
simmer for 1 hour.

Chop remaining onion and set aside.

Place egg in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and
immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to
12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.

Drain chicken, discarding boiled vegetables. Chop chicken when cool.

In a medium bowl, mix the apple, onion, pickles, almond and salt, if desired.
Add black and red pepper to taste. Stir in enough mayonnaise until the mixture
sticks together well.

Cover a serving dish with lettuce leaves. Mound the chicken salad in the
middle, and sprinkle with additional almonds, if desired. Serve with crackers.
