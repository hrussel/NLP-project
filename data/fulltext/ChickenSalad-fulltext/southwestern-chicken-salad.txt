Steps

Fill a large skillet with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Add lemon slices, bay
leaf, peppercorns and 2/3 of the thyme, and bring to boiling over high heat.
Add chicken, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-18 minutes, turning chicken
once, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink. Remove chicken
from liquid and set aside to cool.

In a small skillet, stir together the paprika and remaining thyme over medium-
low heat for 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the toasted paprika
mixture, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt, ground pepper and nutmeg until evenly
blended.

Cube cooled chicken and transfer to a medium bowl. Add prepared dressing,
corn, cilantro, orange pepper and jalapeno and toss until evenly coated. Serve
warm, or refrigerate until ready to serve.
