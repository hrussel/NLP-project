Steps

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Place breasts into a glass baking dish
and marinate in steak sauce for 15 to 60 minutes.

Grill chicken until no longer pink and the juices run clear. Remove from
grill, and chop into bite-size pieces.

To a large pot of boiling water, add bouillon cubes and pasta. Cook pasta
until al dente. Drain, and rinse under cold water.

In a large bowl, combine chicken, pasta, onion, avocados and tomatoes. Mix in
salad dressing, cover, and refrigerate until chilled.
