Steps

Bring a pot of water to a simmer over low heat. Add the chicken breast to the
water and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear,
about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the water
and allow to cool before shredding the meat into a large bowl.

While the chicken cooks, bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
the macaroni at a boil until cooked through, but is still firm to the bite,
about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cool water to halt the cooking process
until the pasta is cool to the touch. Add to the bowl with the chicken.

Stir the pineapple, apple, celery, carrot, and raisins to the bowl; toss to
combine. Add the mayonnaise, sugar, and seasoned salt; gently stir the mixture
until evenly coated. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.
