Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until
tender, about 8 minutes. Add broccoli florets and asparagus to the boiling
water during the last 5 minutes. Drain, and run under cold water to cool.

In a large serving bowl, stir together the diced chicken, kidney beans, black
olives, green pepper, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese and Italian dressing. Stir
in the pasta, broccoli and asparagus. Season with salt and pepper to taste. I
like it pretty heavy on the pepper. This salad is best if chilled for a couple
of hours before serving.
