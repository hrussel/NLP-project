Steps

Cook ramen noodles according to package directions, without adding the flavor
packets. Drain noodles and cool. Cut noodles into large bite size pieces.

In a large bowl combine the torn spinach leaves, cooked turkey or chicken,
halved grapes, red pepper, cashews, Gorgonzola or blue cheese, and ramen
noodles.

In a small bowl mix flavor packets, garlic, and lemon juice and let stand at
least 15 minutes. Add oil and mayonnaise and whisk until smooth.

Pour dressing over salad and toss until thoroughly mixed. Garnish with red
pepper rings and small grape clusters, if desired. Serve.
