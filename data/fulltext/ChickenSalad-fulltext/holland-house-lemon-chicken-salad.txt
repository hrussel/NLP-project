Steps

Place cooking wine and chicken in large saucepan. Add enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer 10 minutes or until chicken is tender and
no longer pink.

Let chicken cool in liquid 45 minutes. Drain; cut chicken into bite-sized
pieces.

In large bowl, combine chicken, pea pods, celery, onions, mayonnaise, lemon
peel and pepper; mix well. Cover; refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to blend flavors.

Just before serving, stir in almonds. To serve, spoon chicken salad onto
lettuce-lined plates.
