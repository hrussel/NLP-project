Steps

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add sesame seeds, and cook stirring
frequently until lightly toasted. Remove from heat, and set aside.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8
to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain pasta, and rinse under cold water
until cool. Transfer to a large bowl.

In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar,
sesame oil, sugar, sesame seeds, ginger, and pepper. Shake well.

Pour sesame dressing over pasta, and toss to coat evenly. Gently mix in
chicken, cilantro, and green onions.
