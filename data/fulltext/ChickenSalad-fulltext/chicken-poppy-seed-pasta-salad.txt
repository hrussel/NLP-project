Steps

Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat; lightly oil the grill.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook
the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but is still
firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well.

While pasta is cooking, grill the chicken breast halves until the meat is no
longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chicken
breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow to rest for about 5
minutes, then slice into bite-size pieces; keep warm.

In a large salad bowl, lightly toss together the grilled chicken, hot cooked
linguine, romaine, green pepper, red onion, and cucumber.

In a separate bowl, whisk together safflower oil, cider vinegar, sugar, poppy
seeds, dry mustard powder, and green onions until smooth and evenly blended.
Pour the dressing over the salad to serve.
