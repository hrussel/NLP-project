Steps

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.

Mix black beans, salsa, 1/2 cup cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl; set aside.

Stir chili powder, cumin, coriander, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, and olive
oil in a bowl until smooth; rub mixture over chicken breasts.

Cook chicken breasts on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and
the juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
While the chicken is cooking, place tortillas on grill and grill until lightly
brown on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes.

Transfer chicken to a cutting board and slice into long thin strips. Divide
chicken strips over tortillas and top with bean mixture, lettuce, and
remaining 1/2 cup cilantro. Serve with avocado, lime wedges, and sour cream.
