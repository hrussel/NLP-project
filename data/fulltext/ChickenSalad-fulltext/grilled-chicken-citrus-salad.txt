Steps

In a mixing bowl, whisk together orange juice, lime juice, shallots, garlic,
chili powder, cumin, and sugar. Pour 1/2 of this mixture into a large,
resealable plastic bag, and add the chicken breasts. Seal, and refrigerate for
at least 2 hours. Refrigerate the remaining dressing.

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. In a large salad bowl, toss
romaine lettuce with oranges, celery, and green onions. Set aside.

Lightly oil grate, and place chicken on grill. Discard the marinade from the
chicken. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes each side, or until juices run clear when
pierced with a fork. Remove chicken from grill, and slice into thin strips.

Toss salad with reserved dressing, and top with sliced chicken.
