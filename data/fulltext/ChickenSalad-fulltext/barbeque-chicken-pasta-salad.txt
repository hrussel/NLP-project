barbeque-chicken-pasta-salad

Steps

Place the chicken breasts into a saucepan over medium-low heat, and pour in 1
cup of barbeque sauce. Simmer the chicken until the meat is no longer pink
inside, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool, and dice chicken meat.

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the shell pasta, and return to a
boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink. Rinse pasta with cold water until chilled, and
drain again thoroughly.

In a large salad bowl, whisk 1 cup of barbeque sauce with mayonnaise until
thoroughly combined. Mix in the cumin, then stir in cooked chicken. Place
cooked pasta, jicama, red and orange bell peppers, corn, cilantro, black
beans, jalapeno peppers, and red onion into the salad bowl, and gently fold to
combine with the dressing. Serve warm or chilled.
