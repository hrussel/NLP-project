asparagus-and-artichoke-pasta-salad

Steps

Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly
brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add asparagus
and cook until tender, about 1 minute. Strain asparagus out of water and
immediately plunge into a bowl filled with ice water; let sit in ice water
until completely cold, then cut into 1 inch pieces. Next, add pasta to boiling
water and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, rinse with cold
water until chilled, then drain well.

Stir together mayonnaise, balsamic vinaigrette, lemon juice, and
Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl. Fold in artichoke, chicken, cranberries,
almonds, crumbled bacon, and asparagus. Season to taste with salt and pepper,
then fold in cooked pasta. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
