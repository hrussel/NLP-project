Steps

Preheat the grill for high heat. Season both sides of chicken breast halves
with steak seasoning.

Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until
juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and cut into strips.

Meanwhile, place the rotini pasta in a large pot of lightly salted boiling
water. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and rinse with cold water
to cool.

In a large bowl, mix together the cheese, onion, lettuce, and tomatoes. Toss
with the cooled chicken and pasta to serve.
