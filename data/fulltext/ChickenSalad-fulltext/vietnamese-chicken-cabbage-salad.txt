vietnamese-chicken-cabbage-salad

Steps

In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, onions, and chicken. Toss with
olive oil until everything is lightly coated. Season with salt and pepper and
continue to toss while adding lemon juice. Add enough lemon juice so that you
can taste it in every bite. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before
serving. The longer it sets the more the flavors mesh together and the better
it tastes!
