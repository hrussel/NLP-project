Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling
water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to
12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.

Whisk Italian-style dressing and mayonnaise together in a large bowl. Stir
pasta, chicken, bacon, Muenster cheese, celery, green bell pepper, cherry
tomatoes, and avocado into dressing until evenly coated.
