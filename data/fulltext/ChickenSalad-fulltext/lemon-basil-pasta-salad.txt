Steps

Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Season chicken
breasts with salt and black pepper.

Cook chicken breasts on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Cut chicken into cubes.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil
until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Season pasta with
garlic salt.

Whisk vegetable oil, lemon juice, basil, and Parmesan cheese together in a
large bowl. Add pasta, chicken, and spinach leaves. Toss to coat.

Cover and chill for 2 hours before serving.
