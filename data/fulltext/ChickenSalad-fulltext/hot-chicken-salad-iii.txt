Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large bowl combine the chicken, salt and pepper, rice, soup, mushrooms,
celery, onion, almonds and mayonnaise. Mix well and spread mixture into an
ungreased 9x13 inch baking dish.

Spread a generous layer of butter or margarine onto one side of each slice of
bread, then tear bread into small pieces and place on top of chicken mixture
to form a top 'crust'.

Place baking dish on center oven rack and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees
C) for about 30 minutes, or until crust is crisp and golden and mixture is
bubbly around the edges.
