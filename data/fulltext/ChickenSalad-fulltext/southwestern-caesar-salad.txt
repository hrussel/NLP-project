Steps

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.

Sprinkle chicken breasts with fajita seasoning, and grill for about 4 minutes
on each side, or until no longer pink and juices run clear. Allow to cool,
then slice into bite-size strips.

In a blender or food processor, combine mayonnaise, grated Parmesan cheese,
sour cream, anchovies, green onions, parsley, Dijon mustard, chipotle pepper,
garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. Blend until smooth.

Place romaine lettuce in a large bowl, and top with croutons, shredded
Parmesan, and red, yellow, and orange pepper rings. Arrange chicken on top,
then pour on the dressing.
