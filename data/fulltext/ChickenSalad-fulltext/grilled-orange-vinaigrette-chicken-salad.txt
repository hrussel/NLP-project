Steps

Preheat grill for medium-high heat.

In a bowl, whisk together the orange juice, vinegar, olive oil, seasoning
blend, and sugar. Set aside about 1/2 cup for basting.

Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken for 6 to 8 minutes on each side,
basting frequently with the reserved portion of the dressing, or until juices
run clear. Cool, and cut into strips. Discard basting sauce.

In a large bowl, toss together the lettuce, oranges, broccoli, and carrots.
Top the salad with grilled chicken strips, and drizzle with remaining dressing
to serve.
