Steps

Preheat the grill for high heat.

Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken 8 minutes on each side, or until
juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and slice.

Meanwhile, place pecans in a dry skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pecans
until fragrant, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat, and
set aside.

In a blender, combine the red wine vinegar, sugar, vegetable oil, onion,
mustard, salt, and pepper. Process until smooth.

Arrange lettuce on serving plates. Top with grilled chicken slices,
strawberries, and pecans. Drizzle with the dressing to serve.
