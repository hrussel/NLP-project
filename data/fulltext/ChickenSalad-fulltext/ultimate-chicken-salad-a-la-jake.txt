Steps

Place chicken breasts into a saucepan with enough water to cover them. Bring
to a boil, then cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until cooked
through. Drain, and set aside to cool.

While the chicken is poaching, whisk together egg yolks and garlic until light
colored. Whisk in olive oil in a thin stream until fully incorporated. Flavor
with lemon juice and salt to taste. This is the aioli sauce.

Shred or cut chicken into small pieces, and place in a salad bowl. Toss with
the olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and thyme. Stir in 3/4 cup of the aioli until
everything is evenly coated. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired.
Refrigerate, or serve immediately. Make a pleased groaning sound as you eat
it.
