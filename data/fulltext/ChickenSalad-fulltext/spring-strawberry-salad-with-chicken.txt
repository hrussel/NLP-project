spring-strawberry-salad-with-chicken

Steps

Place the chicken breast meat into a skillet with 2 tablespoons of olive oil
and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinaigrette over medium heat; cook and stir
until the chicken is browned, no longer pink in the center, and the juice has
nearly evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove the chicken to a bowl and let
cool.

Place the spinach into a salad bowl; scatter the strawberries, goat cheese,
and candied pecans over the spinach. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2
tablespoons of balsamic vinaigrette over the salad and top with the chicken.
Serve slightly warm or chilled.
