Steps

TO MAKE DRESSING: Whisk the mayonnaise, green onions, buttermilk, dill and
ground black pepper in a small bowl to blend (can be made 1 day ahead). Cover
and chill.

TO MAKE SALAD: Arrange the chicken in a heavy, medium size skillet. Add the
wine, dill and ground black pepper. Season with salt. If necessary, add water
to cover the chicken. Simmer over medium low heat until chicken is just cooked
through, turning once (about 11 minutes). Transfer chicken to a plate and let
cool.

Cut chicken into 1/2 inch pieces. Place in a large bowl. Add the grapes and
the celery and mix in the dressing to thoroughly coat the mixture. Season with
salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes to
develop the flavors. (Can be prepared up to 3 hours ahead).

Arrange the lettuce leaves on plates, mound on the salad and sprinkle with
nuts. Garnish with fresh dill and serve.
