Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow tie pasta and return to
a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has
cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in
a colander set in the sink.

Combine pasta, chicken, ham, Swiss cheese, and broccoli in a large bowl. Set
aside. Blend honey, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, onion, olive oil, sugar, and
garlic salt in a blender. Stir in parsley. Stir dressing into the pasta,
reserving 1/2 cup of dressing. Chill salad and reserved dressing in the
refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Stir in the remaining dressing and Parmesan
cheese before serving.
