Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add bouillon cube and
stir until melted. Add chicken and poach for about 13 to 14 minutes. Remove
chicken and leave broth in pot; cool chicken and cut into 1/2 inch chunks;
reserve.

Add mushrooms to broth and cook over medium heat; cook for a few minutes and
remove mushrooms from stock; reserve.

With remaining stock in pot, add some more water, if needed. Bring water to a
boil and add pasta to cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and
discard stock. Cool pasta with running water; reserve.

In a small bowl, combine sour cream, mayonnaise, garlic, curry powder and salt
and pepper to taste.

In a large bowl, combine cooled pasta, chicken, mushrooms, sour cream
dressing, olives, apple, yellow bell pepper and celery; mix well. Refrigerate
for at least 3 hours and serve.
