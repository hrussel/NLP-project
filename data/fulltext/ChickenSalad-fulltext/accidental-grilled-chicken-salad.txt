Steps

Place chicken breast halves in a large resealable plastic bag with lemon
juice, olive oil, and lemon pepper. Shake to coat, and marinate in the
refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

Preheat a grill for high heat.

Lightly oil the grill grate. Place the Vidalia onions and mushrooms on the
grill, and cook until lightly charred on both sides; set aside. Place chicken
onto the grill, and discard marinade. Cook for 15 minutes, turning once, or
until juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and chop.

In a large bowl, thoroughly mix the onions, mushrooms, chicken, and
mayonnaise. Season with hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Cover, and refrigerate
until serving.
