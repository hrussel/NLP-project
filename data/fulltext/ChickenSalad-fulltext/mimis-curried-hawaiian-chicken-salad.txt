Steps

Place chicken in a large pot of lightly salted water, and bring to a boil;
simmer until tender and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Drain, set aside.
When cool enough to handle, chop coarsely, and place into a large bowl.

In a separate bowl, stir together mayonnaise, curry powder, lemon juice, and
soy sauce.

Stir into the chopped chicken 2 1/4 cups of the toasted almonds. Stir in
grapes, celery, water chestnuts, and pineapple. Gently fold in all but 1/2 cup
of the dressing. Cover, and refrigerate salad and reserved dressing for
several hours (or overnight).

Before serving, adjust dressing to taste, and garnish with paprika and
remaining 1/4 cup almonds.
