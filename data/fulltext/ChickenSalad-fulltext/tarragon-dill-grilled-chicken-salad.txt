Steps

To make the marinade, mix 1/2 cup lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and red
pepper flakes together in a bowl.

Place the chicken breasts on a flat surface, and cut from one side through the
middle of the breasts to within one half inch of the other side. Open the two
sides and spread them out flat like an open book. Place in a shallow dish, and
pour the olive oil mixture over the chicken, turning once to coat evenly with
marinade. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

To make the dressing, mix the sour cream, mayonnaise, vinegar, and 1/4 cup
lemon juice together in a bowl, and blend thoroughly. Set aside.

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grill grate, and
place about 4 inches from heat source.

Remove chicken from marinade, and discard marinade. Cook chicken on preheated
grill, turning once, until meat is firm, and juices run clear, about 4 to 5
minutes per side. Remove chicken from grill, and cool. Finely chop chicken,
and place in a large bowl.

Add the grapes, apples, celery, tarragon, and dill to the bowl with the
chicken. Stir in the mayonnaise dressing, and toss until ingredients are
evenly coated. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, or
refrigerate overnight to let flavors blend further.
