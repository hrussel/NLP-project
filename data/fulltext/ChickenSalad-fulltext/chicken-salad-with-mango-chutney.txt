Steps

Bring a pot of water to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer; add rosemary. Poach
chicken in the hot water until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165
degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and allow to
cool. Discard broth. Chop chicken into chunks.

Mix chicken, apple, celery, red onion, mayonnaise, chutney, lime juice, curry
powder, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Chill in refrigerator to allow
flavors to blend, at least 2 hours. Serve cold or at room temperature.
