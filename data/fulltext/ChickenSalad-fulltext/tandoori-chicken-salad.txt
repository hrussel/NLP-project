Steps

In a small bowl, whisk together honey mustard dressing, ground cumin, and
curry powder. Cover, and refrigerate until serving.

In a baking dish, whisk together yogurt, garam masala, and lemon juice. Place
chicken breasts in the dish, and turn to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for at
least 1 hour, turning occasionally.

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly brush oil over grill grate.
Grill chicken until done, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.

In a small bowl, mix together onion, raisins, almonds, and pineapple.

In a large bowl, toss salad greens with salad dressing and 3/4 of the almond
mixture. Divide salad among 4 plates. Sprinkle equal amounts of reserved
almond mixture over each salad. Top each with grilled chicken, and garnish
with a mint sprig and a lime wedge.
