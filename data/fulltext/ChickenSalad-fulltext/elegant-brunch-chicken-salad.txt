Steps

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the chicken and simmer until cooked
through, approximately 10 minutes. Drain, cool and cut into cubes.

While boiling chicken, make the mayonnaise: Using a blender or hand-held
electric mixer, beat the egg, mustard, salt, water and vinegar until light and
frothy. Add the oil a tablespoon at a time, beating thoroughly after each
addition. Once mixture begins to thicken, you can add oil more quickly.
Continue until mixture reaches the consistency of creamy mayonnaise. NOTE: The
more oil you add, the thicker it gets; you may not need the full cup of oil.

In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, grapes, pecans, blue cheese and 1
cup of the mayonnaise. Stir until evenly coated, adding more mayonnaise if
necessary. Refrigerate until serving.
