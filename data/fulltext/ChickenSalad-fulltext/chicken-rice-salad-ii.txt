Steps

Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat
to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has
been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken
breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut the chicken into bite size pieces.

Toss chicken, rice, and lettuce in a large bowl. Serve immediately.
