Steps

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.

Combine the hot sauce, chili powder, coriander, tandoori paste, oregano,
vinegar, lemon juice, and oil in a small bowl. Coat each piece of chicken with
the sauce, then discard remaining sauce. Cook the chicken on the grill until
juices run clear and the chicken is cooked through, approximately 10 to 15
minutes. Set chicken aside.

Prepare the dressing by mixing the lemon juice, vinegar, hot sauce, salt and
pepper in a small bowl; set aside.

For the salad, combine the lettuce, tomatoes, onion, radishes, carrots, and
pepper in a large bowl. Slice the cooked chicken and add to the salad. Toss
gently with the dressing.
