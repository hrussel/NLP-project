chicken-noodle-salad-with-peanut-ginger-dressing

Steps

To make the dressing, place the peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili-
garlic sauce, brown sugar, ginger, red pepper flakes, and 3 tablespoons of
chicken broth together in a blender or bowl of a food processer. Blend until
smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Thin the dressing to your taste
by adding more chicken broth or water.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the linguine and cook
until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and place pasta into a large mixing
bowl.

Add the chicken, carrots, green onions, red pepper, celery, and cilantro to
the bowl with the linguine. Pour the dressing over the noodle-chicken mixture
and toss until mixture is evenly coated. Divide the salad among eight serving
plates, and sprinkle peanuts over each serving.
