Steps

In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook chicken until no longer pink and
juices run clear. Let rest until cool enough to handle, then shred with two
forks. Set aside 4 cups of shredded meat.

In a medium pot with boiling salted water cook elbow macaroni until al dente.
Drain and rinse under cold water.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl mix together the cooked chicken, drained
vegetables, shredded lettuce, and mayonnaise. Add basil, pepper, salt, and
garlic powder to taste.

Add drained elbow macaroni to chicken mixture. Toss to coat.

Refrigerate for several hours before serving.
