Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with olive
oil or non-stick cooking spray.

Prepare the croutons by spreading bread cubes over prepared baking sheet.
Lightly spray cubes with oil or cooking spray and bake for 20 minutes or until
golden brown. Remove from oven and cool.

Prepare the dressing by whisking together the sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon
juice, mustard, honey, rosemary, salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until
ready to serve.

Prepare the salad by placing the chicken in a pan and cover with water. Bring
just to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook 10 minutes, or
until chicken is cooked through. Remove from heat, drain and cool; dice or
pull into shreds.

Combine the chicken with the celery, raisins and lemon peel.

When ready to serve, stir together the lemon juice and olive oil. Tear the
lettuce into small pieces and toss with the lemon and oil mixture. Divide
between plates and top with the chicken salad. Garnish with onion rings, a
sprinkling of pine nuts and the croutons.
