Steps

In a small bowl, blend vanilla yogurt, lime juice, mango chutney, rice
vinegar, honey, cumin, coriander, and paprika.

Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place chicken, ginger,
and garlic in the skillet. Cook 7 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.

Mix mango, red bell pepper, and green onions into the skillet. Cook about 5
minutes, until pepper is tender and mangoes are heated through. Stir in the
vanilla yogurt mixture. Spoon over romaine lettuce to serve.
