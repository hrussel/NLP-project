Steps

In a medium saucepan, cover wild rice with three inches (7.5 cm) of salted
water. Bring to a boil and boil, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until tender.
Drain the excess water, turn heat to lowest setting, cover rice and let steam
for 15-20 minutes, or until the grains split open. Remove from heat and let
cool.

In a medium skillet over medium heat, saute the chicken lightly in the butter
and oil, cooking gently and thoroughly. Do not overcook the chicken. Cool and
shred the chicken into bite-size pieces.

In a medium bowl, mix together the rice, chicken and water chestnuts. Set
aside.

For the dressing, whisk together the walnut oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.
Pour over the wild rice mixture and combine. To serve, place 2-3 romaine
leaves on each plate and spoon the wild rice mixture onto the leaves.
