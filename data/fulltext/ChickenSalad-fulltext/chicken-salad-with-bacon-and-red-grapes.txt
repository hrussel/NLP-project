Steps

Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about
10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate and allow to cool;
crumble.

Mix cooked chicken, crumbled bacon, water chestnuts, celery, and red grapes in
a large salad bowl.

Whisk mayonnaise, dried parsley, lime juice, onion powder, ground ginger,
Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper together to make a smooth
dressing.

Pour dressing over chicken mixture and stir to coat.

Cover the bowl and refrigerate until cold, at least 30 minutes.
