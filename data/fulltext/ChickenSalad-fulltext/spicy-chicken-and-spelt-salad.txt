Steps

Whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, olive oil, vinegar, peanut butter,
cayenne pepper, ginger, garlic, and serrano in a small bowl; set aside.

Toast spelt kernels in a dry skillet on medium-high heat until the kernels are
browned and some have popped. Remove, place in a mesh strainer, and rinse well
with cold water. Drain. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan;
add 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and stir in spelt kernels. Return to a boil then
cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender, about 1 hour. Drain well
and set aside to cool.

While the spelt is simmering, fill a skillet with 1 quart water, 1/2 teaspoon
salt, and onion. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add chicken breasts, reduce
the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through,
about 15 minutes. Remove chicken from liquid and allow to cool.

Once chicken is cool enough to handle, shred into bite-sized chunks and place
in a large bowl. Stir in spelt, bell pepper, green onions, parsley, cilantro,
carrots, and cabbage. Pour sauce over salad and stir well to combine.
