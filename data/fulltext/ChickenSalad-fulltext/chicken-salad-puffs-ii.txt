Steps

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.

Combine the water and butter with 1/8 teaspoon salt in a saucepan. Bring to a
boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium, and pour in
the flour all at once. Stir vigorously until the mixture forms a semi-
translucent ball. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

Mix in the eggs into the dough, one at a time, adding the next egg only after
the first has been completely incorporated. Drop the dough onto the prepared
baking sheet by the heaping tablespoon.

Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
The puffs should be hollow on the inside, and just browned on the bottom.
Remove from the oven, and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.

To prepare the filling, stir together the onion, celery, raisins, mustard,
mayonnaise, yogurt, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and dill in a bowl until combined. Fold
in the chopped chicken meat until evenly combined. Cut the tops from the
puffs, and spoon the chicken filling inside. Replace the tops before serving.
