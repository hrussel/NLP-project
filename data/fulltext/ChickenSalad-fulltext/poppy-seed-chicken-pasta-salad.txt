Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling
water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 12
minutes; drain, rinse in cold water, and drain again.

Toss pasta, chicken, onion, cranberries, celery, and almonds together in a
salad bowl; drizzle with poppy seed dressing and stir to coat.
