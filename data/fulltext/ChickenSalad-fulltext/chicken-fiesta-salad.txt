Steps

Rub chicken evenly with 1/2 the fajita seasoning. Heat the oil in a skillet
over medium heat, and cook the chicken 8 minutes on each side, or until juices
run clear; set aside.

In a large saucepan, mix beans, corn, salsa and other 1/2 of fajita seasoning.
Heat over medium heat until warm.

Prepare the salad by tossing the greens, onion and tomato. Top salad with
chicken and dress with the bean and corn mixture.
