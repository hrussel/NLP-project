Steps

Mix dressing ingredients in a small bowl; keep chilled until ready to toss
with salad. (Store in clean jar with lid.)

Bring 1 gallon of water and 2 Tbs. of salt to boil in a large soup kettle. Add
pasta and, using package times as a guide, boil, stirring frequently and
adding asparagus the last 1 minute, until just tender. Drain thoroughly (do
not rinse) and dump onto a large, lipped cookie sheet. Set aside to cool while
preparing remaining salad ingredients.

Place all salad ingredients (except buttermilk dressing) in a large bowl or
transfer to a gallon-size zippered bag. (Can be covered and refrigerated
several hours at this point.) When ready to serve, add dressing; toss to coat
and serve.
