Steps

In a jar, combine lime juice, sugar, lime zest, rice vinegar, and mustard.
Shake well, and set aside. In a small bowl, mix chicken with limeade
concentrate and pepper.

Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook and stir chicken 4 to 6
minutes, or until no longer pink, and juices run clear.

Divide lettuce onto 4 salad plates. Top with mandarin orange segments, golden
raisins, and walnuts. Place cooked chicken on top, and drizzle lightly with
dressing.
