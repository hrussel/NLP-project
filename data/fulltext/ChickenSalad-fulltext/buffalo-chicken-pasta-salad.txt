Steps

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over
high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a
boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked
through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a
colander set in the sink.

Stir together the mayonnaise, blue cheese dressing, buffalo wing sauce, salt
and pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken, bell peppers, red onion, and
cooked pasta and toss to coat with the dressing. Cover and chill at least 1
hour in the refrigerator before serving.
