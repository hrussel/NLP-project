Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8
to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and pour pasta into a large dish.

Stir in the corn, mushrooms, celery, onions, olives, bell pepper and cheese.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the salad dressing and mayonnaise, then
pour this mixture over the salad and toss again, to coat. Add flaked chicken
and toss gently a final time.
