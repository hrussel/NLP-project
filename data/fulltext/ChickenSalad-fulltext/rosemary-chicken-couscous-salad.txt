rosemary-chicken-couscous-salad

Steps

Place chicken stock in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Stir in couscous. Remove pan from the heat; cover, and let stand for 5
minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork. Cool for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the dressing by combining the olive oil, lemon juice, and
vinegar in the bowl of a blender or food processor; mix on low until mixture
thickens. Stir in rosemary. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Combine the chicken, cucumber, sun-dried tomatoes, and olives in a large bowl.
Stir in the couscous, Feta cheese, and parsley. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Toss the salad with half the dressing. Taste, and add more dressing as
desired, or, if making the salad in advance, add additional dressing just
before serving.
