Steps

Mix soy sauce and sesame oil in a bowl; rub mixture over chicken breasts.
Season with salt and pepper.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook marinated chicken in the hot
skillet until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20
minutes. Dice chicken when cool enough to handle and transfer to a large bowl.

Combine water, long grain and wild rice mix, and butter in a saucepan; bring
to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pan, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid
is absorbed, about 25 minutes.

Mix rice, mandarin oranges, water chestnuts, green onion, celery, and almonds
with diced chicken; toss well. Chill mixture in refrigerator for at least 15
minutes.

Line a large platter with lettuce leaves; top with chicken mixture. Sprinkle
noodles around salad.
