Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling
water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about
10 minutes. Drain and keep warm.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken,
garlic, and Greek seasoning until chicken is no longer pink in the center and
juices run clear, about 10 minutes. Add spinach, cucumber, tomato, olives, and
vinaigrette; lower heat and simmer until spinach begins to wilt, 5 to 10
minutes. Serve over orzo; top with feta cheese.
