Steps

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add chicken and cook until thoroughly
cooked and no longer pink inside, approximately 20 minutes. Drain, cool and
chop.

Meanwhile, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to
a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water
for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and slice.

In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, sliced eggs, apple, onions, relish,
mayonnaise, celery, pineapple (with just a little juice for flavor), cilantro,
pecans and fajita seasoning to taste.
