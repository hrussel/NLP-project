Steps

Preheat the grill for high heat.

Lightly oil the grill grate. Place chicken on the grill, and cook 6 minutes
per side, or until juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and slice.

In a large bowl, mix the red leaf lettuce, green leaf lettuce, tomato,
cilantro, corn, and black beans. Top with the grilled chicken slices and
French fried onions.

In a small bowl, mix the Ranch dressing and barbeque sauce. Serve on the side
as a dipping sauce, or toss with the salad to coat.
