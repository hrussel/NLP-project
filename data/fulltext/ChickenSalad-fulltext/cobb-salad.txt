Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to
a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12
minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.

Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly
brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.

Divide shredded lettuce among individual plates.

Evenly divide and arrange chicken, eggs, tomatoes, blue cheese, bacon, avocado
and green onions in a row on top of the lettuce.

Drizzle with your favorite dressing and enjoy.
