Steps

In a large bowl, sift together the cornmeal, flour, salt, black pepper and red
pepper.

Pour buttermilk in a separate large bowl.

Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.

Dip the chicken in the buttermilk, then in cornmeal mixture. Coat lightly and
cook in hot oil until crispy and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper
towels; keep warm.

Combine the rice, red bell peppers, green bell peppers, onion, and chicken in
medium bowl. Place lettuce on bottom of 4 servings bowls or plates. Top with
rice and chicken mixture.

Prepare the dressing by placing the bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over
medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Sprinkle
crumbled bacon over chicken mixture.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings. Add 2 tablespoons water, cider
vinegar, honey, mustard, salt and pepper; heat just to boiling and pour over
salad.
