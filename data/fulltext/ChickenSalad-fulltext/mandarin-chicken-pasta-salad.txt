Steps

To make the dressing, whisk together the ginger root, rice vinegar, orange
juice, vegetable oil, sesame oil, soup mix, sugar, and garlic until well
blended. Cover, and refrigerate until needed.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the bowtie pasta and
cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, and rinse under cold water.
Place pasta in a large bowl.

To make the salad, toss the cucumber, bell pepper, onion, tomatoes, carrot,
spinach, mandarin oranges, chicken, and almonds with the pasta. Pour the
dressing over the salad mixture, and toss again to coat evenly. Serve
immediately.
