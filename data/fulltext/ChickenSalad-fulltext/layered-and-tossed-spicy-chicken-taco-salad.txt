Steps

Whisk tomato sauce, sour cream, mayonnaise, green salsa, and lime juice
together in a bowl until combined. Refrigerate the dressing while making
salad.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onion in hot oil until
translucent, about 5 minutes; stir often. Mix garlic into onion and remove
from heat; stir cooked chicken in skillet and allow chicken to warm.

Transfer chicken mixture to a large salad bowl and sprinkle with Monterey jack
cheese; cheese will warm and soften. Top chicken and cheese with cold lettuce
and pour dressing over salad. Sprinkle in black olives. Toss salad thoroughly
with dressing and sprinkle with crushed tortilla chips to serve.
