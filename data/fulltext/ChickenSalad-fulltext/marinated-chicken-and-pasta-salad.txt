Steps

In a large bowl, combine 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons honey, 2
tablespoons tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons plum sauce, 1 tablespoon
Worcestershire sauce, sesame seeds, and basil. Add chicken, and turn to coat.
Marinate in refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8
to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until no longer
pink, and juices run clear. Drain on paper towels. Allow to cool, then cut
into bite-size strips.

In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, 1 tablespoon
honey, 1 tablespoon tomato sauce, and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce. Mix in
cooked pasta, chicken, and Cheddar cheese. Gently stir in sliced avocado and
cashews just before serving.
