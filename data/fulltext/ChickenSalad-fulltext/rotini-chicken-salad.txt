rotini-chicken-salad

Steps

Fill a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a boil. Cook the chicken
breast in the boiling water until no longer pink in the center and the juices
run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center of the chicken breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
C). Cut the breast into cubes and spread in a single layer on a plate; place
chicken in refrigerator for 1 hour, or until completely cooled.

Fill a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a boil. Stir the pasta into
the boiling water; cook until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm
to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, and rinse thoroughly with cold water to
cool.

Stir the celery, Parmesan cheese, green onions, mayonnaise, sour cream, milk,
parsley, basil, and thyme together in a large bowl. Fold the chicken, rotini,
and peas into the mayonnaise mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Chill in
refrigerator for 1 hour.
