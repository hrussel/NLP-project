Steps

Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season both
sides of chicken with Cajun seasoning, and place in hot oil. Stir in crushed
garlic. Cook chicken 5 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. Remove
chicken from skillet, drain on paper towels, cool slightly, and dice; discard
oil and garlic.

In a small bowl, mix remaining olive oil, balsamic vinegar, mustard, salt, and
pepper.

In a large bowl, gently toss the dressing with the mixed salad greens,
arugula, avocado, sun-dried tomatoes, and olives. Top with diced chicken to
serve.
