Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Warm tortillas so they are pliable. Lightly spray six, 8-ounce custard cups
with nonstick cooking spray and gently press tortilla into each cup. Bake 10
minutes or until brown and crisp. Carefully remove tortillas from cups and
cool on rack. Repeat for remaining tortillas.

Stir together Taco Ranch Dressing and salsa. Moisten chicken with 1 tablespoon
prepared taco dressing mixture. Combine cheeses in small bowl, set aside.
Coarsely chop salad blend and combine with dressing mixture. Toss with cheeses
and chicken.

Fill each tortilla cup with heaping 1/3 cup salad mixture. Garnish with black
olives, tortilla strips and one small dollop sour-cream.
