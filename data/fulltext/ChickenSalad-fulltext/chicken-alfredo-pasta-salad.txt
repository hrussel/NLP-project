Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place chicken breasts onto a roasting pan; season with Italian seasoning,

Cook chicken in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the
juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Set aside to
cool completely.

Cook and stir bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until
crisp, about 10 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate until cool.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotelle pasta at
a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse the
pasta in cold water until cooled; drain.

Combine chicken, bacon, pasta, cucumber, tomatoes, black olives, artichoke
hearts, and green onions in a large bowl.

Pour vinegar and Alfredo sauce over the pasta mixture; stir to combine.

Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
