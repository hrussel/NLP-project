Steps

In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the cranberry sauce and orange
marmalade. Warm and stir until melted and well blended. Remove from the heat
and stir in the lime juice, orange juice and vegetable oil. Remove 1/2 cup of
the mixture and set aside in the refrigerator for later.

Allow the mixture to cool then stir in the lemon vodka and transfer to a large
resealable bag. Season the chicken pieces with salt and lemon pepper; place
them into the bag with the marinade. Seal the bag and marinate in the
refrigerator for at least 1 hour, turning occasionally.

Preheat a grill for medium heat. Remove the chicken from the plastic bag,
discarding the marinade.

Place the chicken pieces on the preheated grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on
each side, or until firm and no longer pink in the center. If you have a meat
thermometer, it should measure 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) when measured in
the thickest part. Remove chicken to a cutting board and allow to rest for
about 5 minutes.

While the chicken is resting, combine the salad greens, cranberries, and
orange segments. Pour the reserved citrus marinade over the salad and toss
lightly to coat. Divide the salad between four serving plates. Slice each
piece of chicken crosswise into 1/2 inch strips. Arrange over the tops of the
salads and sprinkle with orange zest strips.
