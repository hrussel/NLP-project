Steps

Combine 1/3 bottle of balsamic vinaigrette dressing with the chicken tenders
in a bowl. Toss together sliced mushrooms with 1/3 bottle of dressing in a
separate bowl. Reserve the remaining 1/3 bottle. Allow the chicken tenders and
mushrooms to marinate for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven's broiler, and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat
source.

Remove the chicken tenders and mushrooms from the marinade, and drain off the
excess. Broil the chicken and mushrooms until the chicken is browned and
cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the chicken and mushrooms from the
heat, and slice the chicken tenders into bite-sized pieces.

To serve, divide the chopped romaine lettuce between four plates, and top each
with broiled chicken and mushrooms. Sprinkle each plate with cherry tomatoes,
mozzarella cheese, and sliced basil leaves; serve with the remaining
vinaigrette dressing.
