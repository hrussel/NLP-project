Steps

Bring the water, bouillon cubes, and garlic to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in
the quinoa, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is
tender and the water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard the garlic
clove and scrape the quinoa into a large bowl.

Gently stir the chicken, onion, bell pepper, olives, feta cheese, parsley,
chives, and salt into the quinoa. Drizzle with the lemon juice, balsamic
vinegar, and olive oil. Stir until evenly mixed. Serve warm or refrigerate and
serve cold.
