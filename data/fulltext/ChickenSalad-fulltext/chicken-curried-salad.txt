Steps

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until
tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop.

In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and curry powder. Add the
potatoes, chicken, onion and artichoke hearts and mix together until evenly
coated.

Refrigerate until chilled. To serve, arrange over a lettuce bed and sprinkle
with salt and pepper.
