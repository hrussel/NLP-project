Steps

In a covered jar, mix the lime juice, olive oil, salt, garlic, cilantro, chili
powder, and cumin. Cover, and shake until well blended.

Place the lettuce in a large bowl. Toss with the chicken, black beans, onion,
and tomato. Just before serving, toss with the dressing mixture and Parmesan
cheese. Serve with tortilla chips, either crushed over the top of the salad,
or on the side.
