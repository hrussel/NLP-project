Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini pasta and cook
for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

In a skillet over medium heat, place the cubed chicken and dab with ranch
dressing. Pour enough Italian dressing into the skillet to cover the bottom of
the pan. Cook the chicken until it is nice and brown.

Mix together pasta, chicken, black olives and Italian dressing (to taste).
Serve hot or cold.
