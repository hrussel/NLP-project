Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Bake chicken breast halves in a preheated oven until the juices run clear.
About 30 minutes if thawed, 45 minutes if frozen.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini pasta and cook
for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

4 minutes before the pasta is ready, add frozen vegetables. When pasta is
cooked, remove pasta and vegetables from heat, drain. Cut chicken into small
cubes and add to the pasta-vegetable mix. Season with olive oil, pepper, salt.
