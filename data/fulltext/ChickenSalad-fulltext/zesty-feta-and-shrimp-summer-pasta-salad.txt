Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place the chicken in a baking dish, and roast 25 minutes in the preheated
oven, or until juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and cut into bite-
size pieces.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add farfalle pasta, cook
8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Cool to room temperature.

In a large bowl, mix the chicken, pasta, shrimp, olives, tomatoes, carrots,
and cucumber. Toss with balsamic vinegar and feta cheese, and season with
salt-free seasoning blend.
