grilled-pineapple-salad

Steps

Mix beer, honey, Dijon mustard, olive oil, rosemary, garlic powder, salt, and
black pepper in a large resealable plastic bag until thoroughly combined. Add
chicken to the marinade, evenly coat, and squeeze air from the bag. Seal and
refrigerate several hours to overnight, turning bag over occasionally.

Preheat outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.

Twist top from pineapple and cut peel off in long vertical strips. Cut
pineapple into wedges vertically and cut the tough core from each wedge.

Thread marinated chicken tenders onto skewers. Grill chicken and pineapple
wedges on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink inside, chicken
juices run clear, and pineapple wedges are tender and show light brown grill
marks, 10 to 12 minutes. Cut chicken and pineapple into bite-sized pieces.

Toss spinach with pine nuts and mandarin orange segments in a large bowl. Top
salad with chicken and pineapple pieces. Serve on salad plates; drizzle each
serving with 2 teaspoons poppy seed dressing.
