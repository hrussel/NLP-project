Steps

In a shallow dish, arrange chicken breasts and evenly cover with 1 cup of the
salad dressing. Cover tightly and marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes
to an hour.

Preheat your grill to high heat. While grill is preheating, arrange lettuce,
olives and feta cheese in a salad bowl.

Remove chicken from marinade and place on grill. Cook chicken breasts for 6 to
8 minutes per side. Arrange peppers on grill, and baste with the reserved 1/2
cup dressing. (Don't use the leftover chicken marinade!) The peppers will need
only a few minutes - be careful not to burn them!

Remove chicken and peppers from the grill and, when cool enough to handle,
slice into strips. Arrange peppers and chicken on top of the salad and serve
with the last 1/2 cup of dressing.
