Steps

Place the chicken breasts and Italian dressing into a resealable plastic bag.
Mix together to coat the chicken with the dressing, squeeze out excess air,
and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.

Remove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the
remaining marinade. Grill the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the
center, or to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 3
minutes per side. Set aside to cool while preparing the ingredients for salad,
then dice.

Toss the diced apple with the lemon juice in a large mixing bowl until well
coated; drain and discard any excess lemon juice. Place the lettuce into the
mixing bowl, then sprinkle with the diced chicken, avocado, feta cheese,
strawberries, and cranberries. Gently toss the salad with the balsamic
vinaigrette, and serve immediately.
