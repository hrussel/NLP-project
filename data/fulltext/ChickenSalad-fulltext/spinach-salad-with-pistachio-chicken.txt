spinach-salad-with-pistachio-chicken

Steps

Place pistachio in a food processor or blender, and pulse until finely diced.
Sprinkle half of diced pistachios onto a large plate.

Warm oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Press chicken breast halves into
the pistachio pieces, adding more diced nuts to the plate as needed. Sprinkle
chicken breasts with garlic powder and black pepper. Place in the skillet, and
cook until golden brown. Reduce heat to medium low, and cook for about 3 to 5
minutes on each side, until the chicken is no longer pink inside. Remove
chicken to a cutting board, and slice into thin slices.

Into four bowls, place equal amounts of spinach leaves, tomatoes, avocado,
bell pepper, and green onions. Place chicken slices on top. Sprinkle with
Parmesan, pour on Balsamic vinegar, and season with black pepper.
