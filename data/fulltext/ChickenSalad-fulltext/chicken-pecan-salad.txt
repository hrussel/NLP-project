Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a bowl, mix the hot red pepper sauce, margarine, brown sugar,
Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and salt. Mix pecans into the bowl, tossing
to coat evenly. Spread pecans in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake 10
minutes in the preheated oven, stirring often and watching carefully, until
lightly browned. Remove from heat, and set aside.

Rub chicken with the olive oil, place on a baking sheet, and sprinkle with
Greek seasoning. Bake 20 minutes or until juices run clear. Slice into strips.

In a salad bowl, toss together romaine lettuce, chicken strips, cherry tomato
halves, strawberries, grapes, raspberries, and blueberries. Sprinkle with
pecans, and drizzle with dressing.
