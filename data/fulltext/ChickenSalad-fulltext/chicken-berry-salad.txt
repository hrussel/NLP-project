Steps

In a medium bowl, prepare the dressing according to package directions, using
vinegar and oil, and substituting orange juice for the water; set aside.

Preheat the grill for high heat.

Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill the chicken 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or
until juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and slice into strips.

In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, salad greens, strawberries,
blueberries, raspberries, peas, and pecans. Pour in the prepared dressing, and
toss to coat.
