Steps

Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray both sides of the tortillas with the
cooking spray. Line 4 (7-inch) oven-safe bowls with 1 tortilla each. Place the
bowls onto a baking sheet.

Bake for 10 minutes or until the tortillas are golden brown and crisp. Let the
tortillas cool in the bowls on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the
tortillas from the bowls and let cool completely on a wire rack.

Stir the salsa and vegetable oil in a small bowl. Stir the chicken and half
the salsa mixture in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Stir
in the grapefruit, avocado and pecans.

Divide the greens among the tortillas. Top with the chicken mixture. Drizzle
with the remaining salsa mixture.
