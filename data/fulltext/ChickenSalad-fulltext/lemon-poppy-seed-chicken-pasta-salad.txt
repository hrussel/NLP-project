Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the
penne pasta, and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and rinse under
cold water until the pasta is cold; drain well.

Place the drained penne pasta into a large mixing bowl, and stir in the
chicken, celery, cranberries, and green onions. Pour in the salad dressing and
lemon juice; stir until evenly mixed.
