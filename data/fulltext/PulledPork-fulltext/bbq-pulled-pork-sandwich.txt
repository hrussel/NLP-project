Steps

Combine coleslaw mix, pepperoncini peppers, red onion, mayonnaise, lemon
juice, red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon granulated garlic, Dijon mustard, white
sugar, salt, 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion, and lemon pepper in a large bowl.
Toss until well combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).

Combine kosher salt, black pepper, 2 tablespoons granulated garlic, 2
tablespoons granulated onion, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon cayenne
pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon together in a bowl.

Place pork shoulder in a large roasting pan. Rub with 1/4 cup molasses on all
sides and between any crevices. Sprinkle with kosher salt seasoning mixture
and rub over all sides.

Cover pan tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil and roast pork in the
preheated oven until tender and a thermometer inserted reaches 200 degrees F
(95 degrees C), 3 to 4 hours. Transfer pork to a cutting board, reserving pan
juice, and allow to cool slightly before pulling. Using two forks, shred the
pork shoulder into bite-size pieces. Transfer meat to a large bowl and toss
with some of the pan juices to keep it moist.

Pour reserved pan juices into a large pot over medium heat. Add barbeque
sauce, coffee, 1 tablespoon molasses, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, dry mustard,
and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook for 15
minutes. Add shredded pork and stir until warm, about 5 minutes.

Fill each hoagie bun with pork mixture. Top with 1 to 2 cups coleslaw. Garnish
with 1 tablespoon onion and 1 tablespoon jalapeno.
