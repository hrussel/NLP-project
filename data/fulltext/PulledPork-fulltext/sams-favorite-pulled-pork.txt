Steps

Season pork tenderloin with salt, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
pepper.

Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; fry pork in hot oil until browned
on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meat to a slow cooker. Add water,
brown sugar, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and hot sauce.

Cook on Low for 7 hours. Remove tenderloin to a platter and drain cooking
liquid, reserving about 1/2 cup. Shred pork and return to slow cooker. Add
enough reserved liquid to moisten meat.

Whisk mayonnaise, white vinegar, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and 1 pinch
cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Serve mayonnaise sauce with shredded pork.
