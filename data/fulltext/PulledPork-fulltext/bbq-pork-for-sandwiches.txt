Steps

Pour can of beef broth into slow cooker, and add boneless pork ribs. Cook on
High heat for 4 hours, or until meat shreds easily. Remove meat, and shred
with two forks. It will seem that it's not working right away, but it will.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the shredded pork to a
Dutch oven or iron skillet, and stir in barbeque sauce.

Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through.

Ingredients
