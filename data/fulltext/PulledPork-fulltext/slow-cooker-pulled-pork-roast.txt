Steps

Remove all string from the roast and trim away excess fat. Place the chili
powder in a bowl; blend in the oil, chili, pepper, cumin, coriander, paprika,
allspice, salt and garlic to make a paste. Rub all over the pork, working the
spice mixture into the meat well. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or
overnight. Transfer the roast to a slow cooker.

Blend the ketchup with the vinegar, molasses and mustard. Pour mixture over
the roast and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours or until very tender.

Transfer the roast to a large bowl; discard any visible fat. Use two forks to
separate the meat into long strands. Remove 1 1/2 cups of the cooking juices
and strain into a saucepan. Whisk in the cornstarch and bring to a boil. Cook,
stirring, until thickened and bubbling. Return the shredded meat to the slow
cooker; stir to combine with remaining cooking juices. Serve the meat on soft
rolls; drizzle with thickened sauce mixture to taste.
