Steps

Place the pork shoulder, oranges, onion, garlic, kosher salt, cumin, black
peppercorns, and bay leaves into a large Dutch oven. Add water to cover. Bring
to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for
10 minutes. Skim off any foam that rises to the top. Cover loosely, and simmer
until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Allow the pork to cool, covered,
in the broth for 1 hour. Shred the meat with two forks.

2 oranges, quartered

1 large white onion, quartered

6 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed

1/4 cup kosher salt

1 tablespoon ground cumin
