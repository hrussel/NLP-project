Steps

If desired, soak the pork butt in a brine solution for at least 4 hours or
overnight. There's a recipe for a brine on this site titled 'Basic Brine for
Smoking Meat'. You should do this covered and in the refrigerator.

Preheat an outdoor smoker for 200 to 225 degrees F (95 to 110 degrees C).

In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, chili powder and any additional
seasonings to your taste. Apply this liberally to the meat and rub it in with
your fingers. Place a roasting rack in a drip pan and lay the meat on the
rack.

Smoke at 200 to 225 degrees F (95 to 110 degrees C) for 6 to 18 hours, or
until internal pork temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
