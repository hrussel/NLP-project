pork-barbeque

Steps

In a bowl, mix the wine, white pepper, liquid smoke, garlic, black pepper,
pepper sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Place pork in a slow cooker, and cover
with the sauce mixture. Cover, and cook 4 to 5 hours on Low, or until the meat
shreds easily.

Shred the pork with a fork. Mix in the barbeque sauce, onion, green bell
pepper, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper. Continue cooking 30 minutes,
or until vegetables are tender.

Place pork in a strainer to remove excess liquid, pushing down with a large
spoon to extract as much moisture as possible. Liquid may be reserved as a
dipping sauce.
