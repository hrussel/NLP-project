Steps

Cut rows of deep slits into both sides of pork butt using a sharp knife;
insert a garlic clove into each slit. Rub vegetable oil over pork butt.

Mix Creole seasoning, brown sugar, white sugar, paprika, garlic powder, black
pepper, mustard, cumin, and ginger together in a bowl; coat pork butt with
spice mixture. Wrap coated pork butt with aluminum foil and refrigerate for 8
hours to overnight.

Heat an infrared turkey fryer or a large skillet over medium-high heat; remove
aluminum foil from pork butt. Seer all sides of pork butt in the fryer or hot
skillet until an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) is
reached, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Wrap the seared pork butt tightly in aluminum foil.

Preheat the roaster or oven to 265 degrees F (130 degrees C).

Place wrapped pork butt in the preheated roaster or oven until pork is easily
shredded, 3 to 4 hours. Remove pork butt from aluminum foil and pull meat
apart.
