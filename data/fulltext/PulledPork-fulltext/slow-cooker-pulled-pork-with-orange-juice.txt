slow-cooker-pulled-pork-with-orange-juice

Steps

Place pork butt in a slow cooker with the fattier side facing upwards. Pour
water and orange juice into the slow cooker. Season pork and liquid with salt
and pepper.

Mix garlic and mustard together in a small bowl; spread over the top of the
pork butt. Sprinkle onion over the pork.

Cook on Low, turning the butt a few times, until the meat falls apart easily
when pulled with a fork, 6 to 8 hours.

Remove pork from slow cooker; allow to sit until cool enough to handle. Trim
away and discard any visible chunks of fat. Shred remaining pork into strands.
Return shredded pork to the slow cooker; stir. Remove portions of pork from
slow cooker with a slotted spoon to serve.
