Steps

Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).

Score fat layer on pork shoulder by making shallow cuts in a diamond pattern.
Spread garlic, parsley, sage rosemary, and thyme over pork. Place pork in a
large roasting pan, fat side up. Pour cider over pork.

Bake in the preheated oven for 8 hours. Transfer pork to a large platter;
remove and discard any large pieces of fat and skin. Pour pan drippings into a
separate pot. Shred meat and return to the roasting pan.

Whisk flour into water in a bowl.

Bring drippings to a boil and stir in flour mixture; cook and stir until gravy
is thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour gravy over pork.
