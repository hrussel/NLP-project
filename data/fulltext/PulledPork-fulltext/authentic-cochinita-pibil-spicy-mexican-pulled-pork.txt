Steps

Combine the onion, habanero peppers, lime juice, and salt in a bowl; cover and
refrigerate while preparing and cooking the pork. Use rubber gloves when
preparing the habanero peppers and avoid touching your eyes, nose, or skin
while slicing peppers.

Place the guajillo peppers in a bowl; pour enough hot water over the peppers
to cover. Allow to soak until the peppers are softened, about 10 minutes.

Heat the oil in a large skillet at medium-high heat. Season pork with salt and
pepper; cook in the hot oil until completely browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
Transfer the pork to a slow cooker.

Combine the guajillo peppers, orange juice, vinegar, garlic, and achiote paste
in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour the sauce over the pork cubes in the
slow cooker.

Cook on High until the pork easily falls apart, 6 to 8 hours. Remove the pork
to a serving dish and shred with 2 forks. Pour the achiote sauce over the
shredded pork. To serve, top with the onion-habanero salsa.
