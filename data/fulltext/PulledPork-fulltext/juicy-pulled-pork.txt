Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Combine barbeque sauce, mushrooms, tomatoes, onion, brown sugar, garlic,
vinegar, salt, and black pepper in a food processor or blender; pulse until
mixture is blended but still chunky. If the mixture is too thick, add water.

Arrange pork chops in a baking dish and cover with barbeque sauce mixture;
cover with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven until pork is very tender, about 3 hours. Shred
pork with 2 forks.
