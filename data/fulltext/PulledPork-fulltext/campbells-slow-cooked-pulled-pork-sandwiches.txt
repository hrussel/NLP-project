Steps

Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook
until it's well browned on all sides.

Stir the soup, ketchup, vinegar and brown sugar in a 5-quart slow cooker. Add
the pork and turn to coat.

Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 9 hours* or until the pork is fork-tender.

Remove the pork from the cooker to a cutting board and let stand for 10
minutes. Using 2 forks, shred the pork. Return the pork to the cooker.

Divide the pork and sauce mixture among the rolls.
