Steps

Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the chicken
and carrots in the hot oil until the chicken is no longer pink in the center
and the carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger;
cook another 1 minute. Add the shallots and bell pepper; cook another 1
minute.

Whisk together 3 tablespoons of the reserved liquid from the canned pineapple
chunks along with the pineapple chunks, the water, soy sauce, cornstarch,
vinegar, and pepper flakes; stir into the chicken and vegetable mixture and
bring to a boil, stirring until the sauce thickens.
