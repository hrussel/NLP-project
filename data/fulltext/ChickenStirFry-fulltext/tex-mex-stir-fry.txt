Steps

Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until the oil
is very hot, and cook and stir the green and red bell pepper until they are
starting to become tender, about 5 minutes. Set the peppers aside.

Mix flour and taco seasoning in a bowl, and stir in chicken pieces, a few at a
time, to thoroughly coat with the flour mixture. Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil
in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the chicken until
no longer pink and the coating is browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the bell
peppers, black beans, and salsa, and let the mixture simmer for about 5
minutes to blend the flavors.

To serve, sprinkle each portion with Cheddar cheese.
