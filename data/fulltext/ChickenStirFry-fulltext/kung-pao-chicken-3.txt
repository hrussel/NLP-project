Steps

Mix the chicken, 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, salt, pepper, and 1 pinch of
five-spice powder together in a bowl until the chicken is coated, and set
aside.

Whisk together water, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, 1 tablespoon of
cornstarch, rice vinegar, and 1 pinch of five-spice powder in a bowl until the
mixture is smooth, and set aside.

Place 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and
cook and stir the chicken mixture until the chicken is browned, about 5
minutes. Remove the chicken from the wok, and set aside.

Pour 1 more tablespoon of oil into the heated wok, and stir in the onion,
celery, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir the vegetables until they
start to become tender, about 3 minutes. Pour in the cornstarch mixture, and
cook and stir until the sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Remove the wok from
the heat, lightly stir in the cooked chicken and peanuts, and serve.
