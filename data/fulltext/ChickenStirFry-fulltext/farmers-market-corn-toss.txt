Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and red pepper;

into the onion mixture; cook and stir until all vegetables are crisp-tender,
about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.

Sprinkle parsley and about half the cheese over the vegetable mixture and toss
to mix; season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a serving dish
and top with remaining cheese.
