Steps

Stir together 1 teaspoon cooking wine and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl; add the
chicken and stir to coat. Allow to marinate 2 to 3 minutes. Place the
marinated chicken in a large, sealable plastic bag with the cornstarch and
shake to coat.

Heat the peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Fry the chicken
in the oil until it begins to crisp around the edges, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove
the chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve 2 tablespoons of
the oil, discarding the rest.

Reheat the reserved oil in the wok over medium-high heat; cook and stir the
garlic, ginger, and green onions in the oil until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add the green chilies, crushed dried chilies, and Szechuan peppercorns;
continue frying about 20 seconds more. Return the chicken to the wok; stir in
the soy sauce, 2 teaspoons cooking wine, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until
thoroughly combined. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
