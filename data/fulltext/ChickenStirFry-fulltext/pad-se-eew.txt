Steps

Stir the dark soy sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and chile-garlic sauce together in
a small saucepan and place over medium-how heat; simmer and stir until the
sugar dissolves into the sauce, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set
aside.

Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the garlic and
chicken in the hot oil until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 7 to
10 minutes. Stir the broccoli into the chicken mixture; cook and stir until
the broccoli is thoroughly heated. Add the noodles and stir until all the
ingredients are evenly mixed. Pour the sauce over the mixture and stir until
everything is evenly coated; continue cooking until the sauce begins to
thicken.

Push the chicken mixture to the side of the skillet with a spatula. Add the
egg to the skillet in the vacated space. Scramble the egg, cooking it through.
Once egg is cooked, mix ingredients back in and heat thoroughly. Garnish with
the sesame seeds and red pepper flakes to serve.
