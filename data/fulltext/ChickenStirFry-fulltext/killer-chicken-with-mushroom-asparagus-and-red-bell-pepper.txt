Steps

Bring the rice and water to a boil together in a saucepan. Reduce heat to
medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been
absorbed, 35 to 40 minutes.

When the rice is nearly done cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over
high heat. Cook the onion in the hot oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add
the chicken, garlic, and ginger to the skillet and continue cooking and
stirring until the chicken is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Fold the
mushrooms, asparagus, bell peppers, and fish sauce into the chicken mixture;
continue cooking just until hot, about 5 minutes. Crack the egg, and scramble
it into the mixture. Add the basil leaves to the mixture; cook until the
leaves wilt slightly, about 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat immediately.
Serve over the basmati rice; garnish with the cilantro and sesame seeds and a
drizzle of the tamari soy sauce.
