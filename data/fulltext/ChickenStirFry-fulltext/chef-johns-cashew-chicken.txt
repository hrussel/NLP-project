Steps

Season chicken cubes with salt and black pepper.

Mix cornstarch and water in a bowl until smooth; whisk in lemon juice, rice
vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, and chile pepper sauce into
cornstarch mixture, stirring until brown sugar has dissolved and cornstarch is
free of lumps.

Place a heavy skillet over medium-high heat; pour in vegetable oil. Add slices
of red chili and ginger to the hot oil. Cook, stirring often, until oil is
flavored, about 2 minutes. Stir in cashews and garlic; cook until cashews are
lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes more.

Lightly toss seasoned chicken cubes with cashew mixture in skillet until
combined, about 30 seconds. Turn heat down to medium-low and pour cornstarch
mixture into skillet. Stir constantly until sauce has thickened, about 30
seconds. If too thick, add a splash of water. Simmer 2 more minutes to heat
the chicken through. Adjust levels of salt, black pepper, soy sauce, and chile
pepper sauce to taste. Stir in cilantro just until wilted, about 15 seconds.
