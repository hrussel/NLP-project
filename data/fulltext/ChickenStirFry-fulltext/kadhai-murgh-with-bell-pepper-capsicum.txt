Steps

Evenly season the chicken with salt and turmeric; set aside for 15 minutes.

Heat the oil in a large skillet or kadhai over medium heat. Cook the onions in
the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and cook until
browned, about 5 minutes more. Stir the bell peppers and chile peppers into
the chicken; continue cooking another 5 minutes.

Grind the cumin seed, coriander seed, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves,
cardamom pod, and fennel seed into a coarse powder; sprinkle over the mixture
in the skillet. Add the water, coconut milk powder, ground red pepper, and
salt. Cook until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. If the curry is too
wet, cook on high until the moisture evaporates. Garnish with cilantro and
serve hot.
