Steps

Melt butter/margarine in a medium skillet over low heat. Add chicken, onion
and green bell pepper and saute all over low heat for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring
occasionally and turning chicken pieces. Season with paprika, garlic salt and
seasoned salt to taste.

Cover skillet and let cook until chicken is done and juices run clear, about
15 minutes. When chicken is cooked through add soup and water and let simmer,
stirring. When liquid has reached the consistency of a sauce, the dish is
done.
