Steps

Rub the chicken pieces with the turmeric and salt. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large skillet or kadhai over medium heat. Fry the poppy
seeds, peppercorns, fennel seed, coriander seed, and cumin seed in the hot oil
until they just begin to change color; remove from the skillet, keeping the
oil in the skillet. Grind the spice mixture with a mortar and pestle and set
aside.

Add the onion, green chile peppers, curry leaves, ginger paste, and garlic
paste to the remaining oil; cook until the onions are golden brown, 7 to 10
minutes. Stir the tomatoes and ground spices into the mixture; cook until the
tomatoes are softened. Add the chicken. Season with salt and simmer for 5
minutes. Pour the water over the mixture, cover, and cook until the chicken is
no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Serve
hot.
