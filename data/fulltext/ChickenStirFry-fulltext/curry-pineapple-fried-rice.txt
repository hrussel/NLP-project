Steps

Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat
to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has
been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Set the cooked rice aside. Mix together curry
powder, fish sauce, and pineapple juice in a small bowl.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat until
the oil shimmers, and cook and stir the chicken and onion until the chicken is
no longer pink and the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
cooked rice, pineapple chunks, and curry mixture, and cook and stir until the
fried rice is hot, 5 to 10 minutes.
