Steps

Preheat an indoor grill, and coat with cooking spray. Place the chicken strips
on the grill, and cook for about 7 minutes. Allow them to cool slightly, then
cut into cubes.

While the chicken is cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium
heat. Place the onion rings in the skillet, and cook for a few minutes. Add
the red and yellow pepper, baby corn, and the stir-fry vegetables. Increase
the heat to medium-high; cook and stir for about 15 minutes.

Sprinkle in the sugar and salt. Stir in the chicken. Dissolve the cornstarch
in water, and pour into the skillet along with the soy sauce. Cook and stir
until the sauce thickens.
