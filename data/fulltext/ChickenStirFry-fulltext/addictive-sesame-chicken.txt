Steps

Combine the 2 tablespoons soy sauce, the dry sherry, dash of sesame oil,
flour, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 2 tablespoons water, baking powder, baking
soda, and canola oil in a large bowl. Mix well; stir in the chicken. Cover and
refrigerate for 20 minutes.

Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Combine the 1/2 cup water, chicken broth, vinegar, 1/4 cup cornstarch, sugar,
2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons sesame oil, red chili paste, and garlic
in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Turn heat to low
and keep warm, stirring occasionally.

Fry the marinated chicken in batches until cooked through and golden brown, 3
to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

Transfer the chicken to a large platter, top with sauce, and sprinkle with
sesame seeds.
