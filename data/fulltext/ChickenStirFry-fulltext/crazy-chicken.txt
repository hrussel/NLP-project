Steps

Preheat oven to Grill/Broil.

Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and garlic and saute
until chicken juices run clear, about 7 to 10 minutes. Drain fat from skillet
and stir in sauce.

Place chicken mixture on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven for
about 10 minutes, or until browned. Let sit about 5 minutes to allow sauce to
thicken.
