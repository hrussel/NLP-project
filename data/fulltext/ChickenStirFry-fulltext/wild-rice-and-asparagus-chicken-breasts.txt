Cut asparagus into 3/4 inch to 1 inch pieces, discarding tough bottoms of
spears. In a small bowl, mix together the hoisin sauce and brown sugar and set
aside. Prepare rice OR reheat cooked rice and keep warm.

Heat wok over medium high heat. When hot, dribble 1 tablespoon of oil around
the rim. Stir fry asparagus for approximately 2 minutes. Remove from the wok
and keep warm. Heat wok to high heat.

Heat wok to high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil and the chicken pieces and
stir fry until the chicken is no longer pink. Add the reserved asparagus and
hoisin/sugar sauce and stir fry all together until pieces are coated with
sauce. Serve over the hot rice.
