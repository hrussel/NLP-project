Steps

Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a resealable plastic
bag. Add cubed chicken to the bag and shake until well coated.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken; cook and
stir until the chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the bell
pepper, onion, zucchini, mushrooms, chicken broth, and Italian dressing. Cover
and simmer until vegetables and meat are tender, about 10 minutes.
