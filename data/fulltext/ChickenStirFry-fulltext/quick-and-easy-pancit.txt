Steps

Place the rice noodles in a large bowl, and cover with warm water. When soft,
drain, and set aside.

Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic
until soft. Stir in chicken cabbage, carrots and soy sauce. Cook until cabbage
begins to soften. Toss in noodles, and cook until heated through, stirring
constantly. Transfer pancit to a serving dish and garnish with quartered
lemons.
