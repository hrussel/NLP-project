anise-wine-chicken

Steps

Stir the onion, ginger, garlic, star anise, white wine, salt, pepper, 2
tablespoons vegetable oil, rice vinegar, and chicken together in a mixing
bowl. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours. Meanwhile, place
the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil
over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool before cutting in half.

Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Remove
the chicken from the marinade, and squeeze the excess marinade from the
chicken; reserve the marinade. Cook and stir the chicken in the hot oil until
browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Remove
and discard the star anise from the marinade, and stir the marinade into the
chicken. Bring to a boil, then add the cherry tomatoes and halved potatoes.
Cook until the potatoes are hot and the cherry tomatoes begin to burst, about
3 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water, and stir into the chicken
mixture along with Thai basil. Cook and stir until thick, about 1 minute more.
