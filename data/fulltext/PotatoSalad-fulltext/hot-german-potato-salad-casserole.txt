Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring potatoes to a boil in a large pot of salted water. Reduce heat to
medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain; transfer potatoes
to a large baking dish.

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices
on paper towels; crumble and sprinkle over potatoes.

Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir celery and green onion until
celery is tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to baking dish.

Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt, and black pepper in a bowl
until smooth. Pour mixture over potatoes and stir until well mixed. Sprinkle
with Cheddar cheese.

Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, 20 to 35 minutes.
