Steps

Place the Russet potato pieces into a large saucepan, and cover with salted
water. Bring to a boil, turn the heat down, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the
sweet potato, and cook about 15 minutes more. Remove a piece of each potato,
and cut it in half to see if it is cooked enough. Once the potatoes are
tender, add corn kernels; cook another 30 seconds. Drain through a colander.
Fill the saucepan with cold water, and drop vegetables into water. Cool for 5
minutes, and drain.

In a large bowl, whisk together mustard, lime juice, cilantro, and garlic.
Slowly whisk in oil. Mix in salt and black pepper.

Cut cooled potatoes into 1 inch cubes, and add to dressing along with
cucumber, and red onion. Toss well. Serve at room temperature or chilled. Toss
the peanuts in just before serving.
