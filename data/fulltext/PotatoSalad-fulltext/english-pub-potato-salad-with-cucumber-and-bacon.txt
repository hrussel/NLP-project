Steps

Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and
cool. Chop potatoes and transfer into a large salad bowl.

Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices
on paper towels. Crumble bacon when cool.

Stir mayonnaise, crumbled bacon, cucumber, red onion, 3 chopped eggs, celery,
1/2 cup parsley, and 1 tablespoon paprika into the potatoes until thoroughly
combined. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Garnish salad with
slices of hard-cooked egg, 3 sprigs of fresh parsley, and a pinch of paprika.
