Steps

In a blender, combine the oil, vinegar, parsley, salt, sugar, anchovy fillets
and garlic. Puree until smooth.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until
tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and cut into cubes. Pour
prepared vinaigrette over potatoes and marinate overnight.

Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until
evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.

Combine the potatoes and dressing, sausage, green onions, parsley and olives.
Toss together well and season with salt and pepper to taste.
