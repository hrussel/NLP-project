Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Toss halved potatoes with 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup garlic, and seafood
seasoning. Place in a single layer onto baking sheets and bake in preheated
oven until tender and golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of
the potatoes. Once cooked, remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.

Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium heat until
evenly browned and crispy. Pour off bacon grease and reserve. Allow the bacon
slices to cool, then crumble and set aside.

Whisk together balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
Pour in the oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking vigorously to make a
vinaigrette. Toss the roasted potatoes together with the vinaigrette and
reserved bacon grease. Fold in red onion, parsley, and eggs. Allow to stand at
room temperature 20 minutes before serving.
