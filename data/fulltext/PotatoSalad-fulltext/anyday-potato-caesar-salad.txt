Steps

Scrub potatoes and cut in half or quarters, if larger. In a medium saucepan,
cover potatoes with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat; season water
with salt. Reduce heat and boil gently for about 15 min or until potatoes are
tender. Drain and transfer to a large bowl; let cool slightly.

Meanwhile, make Dressing: in a blender, combine cream, garlic, mustard, salt
and pepper; puree until smooth. With motor running, pour in lemon juice. Add
yogurt and pulse to blend. Let stand for 5 min or until thickened.

Add half of the Parmesan cheese and bacon (if using) to potatoes and pour in
dressing; toss gently to coat. Just before serving, add lettuce and toss to
combine. Divide among serving bowls and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan.
