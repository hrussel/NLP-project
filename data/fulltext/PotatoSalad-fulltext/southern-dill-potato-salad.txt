Steps

Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover them with water, and bring to a boil
over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potatoes
are cooked through but still firm, about 20 minutes. Remove from the water,
let cool, and cut the potatoes into chunks. Set the potatoes aside.

In a bowl, stir together the sour cream, mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar,
Dijon mustard, onion, celery, celery salt, and salt and pepper until well
mixed.

Place the potatoes and eggs in a large salad bowl, and sprinkle with dried
dill. Pour the dressing over the potatoes and eggs, and mix lightly. Cover and
refrigerate the salad for at least 30 minutes. Serve cold.
