Steps

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until
tender but still firm, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Peel potatoes
and slice 1/4 inch thick; set aside.

Heat oil in a medium-size skillet; saute onion until soft. Stir in flour,
mustard, celery seed and salt. Gradually add water and vinegar; cook over low
heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils and thickens.

In a mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, green pepper, carrots and dill; add
sauce and mix well. Spoon half the mixture into a shallow 8x8 inch baking dish
and sprinkle with half the cheese. Cover with remaining potato mixture and
cheese.

Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until
cheese is melted and vegetables are heated through.
