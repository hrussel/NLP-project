Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
tender, about 20 minutes. Drain thoroughly.

Meanwhile, place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the
bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate, then crumble. Set the bacon aside.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square
baking dish.

Combine the potatoes, Cheddar cheese, relish, onion, and olives in a large
bowl. Stir in the mayonnaise, celery salt, and black pepper. Transfer the
mixture into the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with bacon.

Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are browned and the cheese is
melted, about 45 minutes.
