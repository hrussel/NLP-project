Steps

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until
tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and
immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to
12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.

In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, turmeric and onion.
Add the still-warm potatoes and stir until evenly coated. Gently mix in the
hard-cooked eggs. Serve immediately, or refrigerate and serve cold.
