Steps

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook peeled potatoes
until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and cube.

Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, and
immediately remove from heat. Cover pan, and let eggs stand in hot water for
10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water and allow to cool. Peel and chop the
eggs, and toss together with the potatoes and vegetables in a large mixing or
serving bowl.

In a separate bowl, combine the mayonnaise, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, ground
mustard, lemon juice, dill weed, and green olives. Stir to blend. Pour
dressing over the potato mixture, season with salt and pepper, and toss to
coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour, or overnight.
