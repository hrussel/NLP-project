Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until easily pierced with a
fork. Drain, and set aside to cool.

In a large bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, relish, mustard, hard-cooked
eggs and celery. Cut the potatoes into cubes, and add to the bowl. Mix gently
until coated. Garnish with a sprinkling of paprika, and arrange crackers
around the edge.
