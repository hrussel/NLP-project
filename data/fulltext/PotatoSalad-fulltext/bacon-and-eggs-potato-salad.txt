Steps

Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and
set aside to cool.

Mix potatoes, mayonnaise, peas, hard-boiled eggs, bacon, onion, mustard, salt,
and black pepper together in a bowl. Refrigerate to allow flavors to blend and
bacon to soften, about 1 hour.
