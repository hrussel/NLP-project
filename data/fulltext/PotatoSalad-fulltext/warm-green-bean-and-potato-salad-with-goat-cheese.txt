Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Place potatoes in a large bowl.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; grease with cooking spray. Cook
and stir the green beans and onion until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute more.

Transfer the green bean mixture into the large bowl with the potatoes. Add the
balsamic vinaigrette, roasted red peppers, and basil; toss lightly. Stir in
the goat cheese.
