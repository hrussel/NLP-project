Steps

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.

Put sliced potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes.
Drain, and set aside.

At the same time, place bacon in a large deep skillet. Cook over medium-high
heat until evenly browned. Remove to paper towels to drain.

In a large bowl, stir together the potatoes, cheese, onion, mayonnaise, salt,
and pepper. Spoon into prepared baking dish. Crumble bacon over the top, and
sprinkle with olives.

Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
