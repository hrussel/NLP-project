Steps

Place potatoes in two separate saucepans and cover with water. Bring to a boil
over high heat, then turn heat to medium-low. Cover, and cook until tender but
still firm, 12 to 14 minutes for sweet potatoes, and 10 to 12 minutes for
white potatoes. Drain and place in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle with vinegar,
and cool.

To make the dressing, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, and
curry powder in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Mix the green onions, celery, and cilantro with the potatoes. Pour the
dressing over the potato mixture, and toss to evenly coat vegetables.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving to let flavors blend.
