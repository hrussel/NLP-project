Steps

Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

Toss the potatoes with 10 tablespoons of vegetable oil; sprinkle with paprika
and dill. Toss until the potatoes are evenly coated with the spices and spread
onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are easily
pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes.

While the potatoes are roasting, heat the 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a
large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the banana pepper, bell pepper,
celery, and onion; cook and stir until the vegetables have softened, about 10
minutes. Toss the pepper mixture with the roasted potatoes in a bowl.
Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.

While the potatoes are cooling, whisk together the red wine vinegar, olive
oil, and kosher salt. Toss the potatoes with the salad dressing just before
serving.
