Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Let the potatoes cool enough to handle, and peel; allow the potatoes to cool
thoroughly. Cut into bite-size pieces.

In a bowl, combine the potatoes, onion, cheese curds, mayonnaise, yellow
mustard, and seasoned salt; mix thoroughly. Top the potato salad with hard-
boiled egg slices and sprinkle with black pepper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours
before serving.
