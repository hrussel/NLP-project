Steps

Place potatoes into a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a
boil, and cook over medium-high heat for 30 minutes, or until tender. Drain,
peel and dice while still hot. This is what will make the salad fluffy. Cover
and refrigerate until cold.

In a large serving bowl, toss together the potatoes, eggs, crabmeat, black
olives and carrot. Sprinkle with sugar, and stir in enough mayonnaise to
moisten. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Chill until ready to serve.
