Steps

Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and
cook for about 5 minutes, until tender but not mushy. Drain in a colander, and
run under cold water to cool. Set aside.

In a large serving bowl, Stir together the eggs, green olives, dill and sweet
pickle relishes, green onion, mayonnaise, yellow and brown mustards, and wine
vinegar. Season with garlic powder, black pepper, white pepper, salt, celery
seed, dill seed, and dill. Mix well, and stir in potatoes until coated. Chill
for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.
