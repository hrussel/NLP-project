Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring
to a boil and cook until tender enough to pierce with a fork. Drain, cool
enough to handle, and cut into cubes.

Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and
crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
Reserve bacon grease.

In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, sour cream, mayonnaise, mustard, green
onions, olives, eggs, Italian seasoning and ranch dressing. Crumble the bacon
into the bowl and pour half of the reserved bacon grease over all. Stir gently
until everything is evenly distributed. Garnish with a dash of paprika before
serving.
