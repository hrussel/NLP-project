Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a
fork. Drain, and set aside to cool.

In a serving bowl, mix together the sour cream, salad dressing, shredded
cheese and hard-cooked eggs. When the potatoes are cool, stir into the
dressing. If you like it creamier, mix longer. Season with salt and pepper to
taste.
