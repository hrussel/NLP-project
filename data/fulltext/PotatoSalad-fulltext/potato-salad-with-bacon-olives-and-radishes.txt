Steps

Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2 to 3/4 inch pieces. Bring a large
pot of salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes and cook until tender but
still firm, about 10 minutes.

Slice the bacon into small pieces and cook over medium high heat in a large,
deep skillet until evenly brown. Do not overcook.

Chop the celery, green onions, stuffed olives and radishes into small pieces
and put into a large bowl. Add the potatoes and bacon and mix together. Add
the mayonnaise and lemon juice to taste, stir, and place in the refrigerator
for a few hours to chill before serving. You may want to add a few sliced hard
boiled eggs on top. ENJOY!!!
