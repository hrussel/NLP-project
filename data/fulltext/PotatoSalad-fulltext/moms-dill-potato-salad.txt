Steps

Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high
heat, then turn heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until tender but still
firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool in an ice water bath until cold, about 5
minutes. Leaving skins on, cut into bite-size pieces, and place in a large
mixing bowl.

Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, dill weed, and green onions in a bowl and stir
until blended. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour mayo mixture over
potatoes and toss to coat evenly. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Cover and
refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight.
