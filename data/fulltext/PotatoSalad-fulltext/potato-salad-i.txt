Steps

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until
tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl.

Place eggs in a medium saucepan, and cover completely with cold water. Bring
water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for
10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and peel under cold, running water.
Chop, and set aside.

Stir the eggs, celery, green bell pepper, sweet pickle cubes, prepared
mustard, mayonnaise, onion and white sugar into the potatoes. Season to taste
with salt and pepper. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3
hours before serving.
