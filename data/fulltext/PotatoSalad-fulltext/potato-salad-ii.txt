Steps

Place potatoes in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Add 2
teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil; cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain,
and allow to cool until easily handled but still warm.

Cut potatoes into bite size pieces, and transfer to a medium mixing bowl. Add
salad dressing, and gently stir until well coated. Season with salt and pepper
to taste. Serve warm.
