Steps

In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with cold salted water and bring to a
boil. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes, adding beans in the last 4 or 5
minutes of cooking. When vegetables are tender, drain. Place in a large bowl;
toss with 2 tbsp olive oil. Add eggs.

Combine remaining 3 tbsp olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt and pepper.
Drizzle vinaigrette over vegetables and eggs; toss gently to combine. Adjust
seasonings, if necessary.

Serve warm.
