Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, then run under cold water until cool.

Combine the sour cream and ranch dressing mix in a small bowl until well-
blended. Transfer the potatoes, bacon, Cheddar cheese, and green onions to a
large bowl. Stir in the sour cream mixture until well-coated. Cover and
refrigerate for about 2 hours before serving.
