Steps

Toss potatoes in oil with herbs, a generous sprinkling of salt and a few
grinds of pepper. Place potatoes, cut side down, in a single layer on a lipped
cookie sheet. Set pan on lowest rack of cold oven; heat oven to 450 degrees.
Roast until cut side is golden brown and potatoes are tender, 20 to 25
minutes.

Transfer potatoes to a large bowl; add olives, onion and parsley.

Whisk vinegar, mayonnaise, garlic, a big pinch of salt and a couple of grinds
of pepper in a 1-cup glass measuring cup. Slowly whisk in oil, first in
droplets, then in a slow, steady stream. Pour dressing over warm salad; toss
to coat. Serve at room temperature for best flavor.
