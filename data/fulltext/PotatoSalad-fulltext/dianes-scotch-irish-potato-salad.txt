Steps

Place potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain
and allow to cool.

Remove skins from potatoes and cut into chunks. Place in a large bowl.

Lightly stir celery, red onion, eggs, black olives, green olives, dill pickle
relish, sweet pickle relish, and paprika with potatoes until thoroughly
combined.

Mix in mustard, vinegar, and mayonnaise; stir lightly until all ingredients
are coated and moist. If salad isn't moist enough, stir up to 1/2 cup more
mayonnaise into salad.

Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste. For best flavor, make the
day before and refrigerate overnight.
