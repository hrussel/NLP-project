Steps

Place potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a
boil and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain and cover
to keep warm.

Preheat oven to broil or preheat a grill for medium-high heat. Season both
sides of steak with salt and pepper. Broil or grill steaks for 6 to 8 minutes
per side, or to desired doneness.

Meanwhile, whisk together oil, vinegar, mustard, and tarragon for dressing;
season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide greens, tomatoes, and shallots among 4 plates. Cut warm, unpeeled
potatoes into quarters; slice steak into 1/4 inch thick strips. Top salad
greens with steak and potatoes; drizzle dressing over salads. Serve warm.
