Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Spread potato pieces onto a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.

and let cool at least 15 minutes.

Place roasted potatoes into a large salad bowl and combine with hard-cooked
eggs, celery, green onion, and bacon; stir in mayonnaise and season to taste

blend.
