Steps

Place potatoes in pressure cooker with water. Cook on high pressure 3 minutes.
If potatoes are larger, cook for 4 minutes. Let steam release for 3 minutes.
Then quickly release pressure and open cooker. Peel and dice potatoes when
they are cool enough to handle.

Alternate layers of potatoes, onion, and celery in a large bowl. Season each
layer with salt and pepper. Top with the chopped egg and sprinkle with dill.

Mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, and cider vinegar in a small bowl.
Gently fold the mayonnaise mixture into the potatoes. Chill at least one hour
before serving.
