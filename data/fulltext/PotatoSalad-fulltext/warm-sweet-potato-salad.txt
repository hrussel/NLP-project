Steps

Place the diced sweet potatoes and potatoes in a Dutch oven, cover with water,
and bring to a boil. Boil until the potatoes are fork tender, but not mushy,
about 20 minutes. Drain and cool the cooked potatoes slightly.

Meanwhile, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, balsamic vinegar, turmeric,
chives, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the bacon, green onions, red
onion and cooked potatoes and toss to coat. Serve garnished with extra chives
or green onion.
