Steps

Place the potatoes in a large pot, and fill with about 1 inch of water. Bring
to a boil, and cook for about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Throw
in the green beans to steam after the first 10 minutes. Drain, cool, and cut
potatoes into quarters. Transfer to a large bowl, and toss with fresh basil,
red onion, salt and pepper. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, mustard, lemon juice,
garlic, Worcestershire sauce and olive oil. Pour over the salad, and stir to
coat. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed.
