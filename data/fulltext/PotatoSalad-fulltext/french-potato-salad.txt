Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until tender
but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl. Cool
slightly. Peel and slice into a large bowl.

In a small bowl, combine oil, vinegar, consomme, green onion, parsley, and
salt and pepper.

Gently toss warm potatoes with dressing. Cover, and refrigerate several hours
or overnight.
