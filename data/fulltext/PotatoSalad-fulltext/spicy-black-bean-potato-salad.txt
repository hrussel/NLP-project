Steps

Place potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook
until tender. Drain, dice, and cool.

Place eggs in a pot with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil and
immediately remove from heat. Cover saucepan, and let eggs stand in hot water
for 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, cool, peel and chop.

Place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook until evenly brown.
Drain, crumble and set aside.

In a large bowl, mix chopped eggs, 1/2 the bacon, black beans, green onions,
jalapeno peppers, bell pepper, mayonnaise, mustard, and Cajun seasoning.
Gently mix in diced, cooled potatoes. Season with salt and pepper, and
sprinkle with remaining bacon. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
