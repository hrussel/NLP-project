Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over
high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender,
about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Chill the
potatoes in cold water, and chop into cubes when cool enough to handle.

Transfer the potatoes into a large salad bowl, and toss lightly with dill
pickles, green onions, celery, cilantro, dill pickle juice, dried dill, 1
teaspoon paprika, salt, and pepper. In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil,
red wine vinegar, and Dijon mustard, and pour the dressing over the potato
mixture. Toss again to coat all ingredients with dressing. Sprinkle with 1/4
teaspoon paprika.
