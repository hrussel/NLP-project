Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until easily pierced with a
fork. Drain, and let them cool slightly. If you wish to peel them, do it while
they are still hot. It will be much easier. Allow to cool completely, then
slice thinly.

Place the potatoes in a large bowl. Dissolve the chicken bouillon in boiling
water, and pour in with the potatoes. Gently stir in the vinegar, egg, pepper,
mayonnaise and parsley. Mix in the olive oil last. Let stand at room
temperature for 15 minutes before serving. This salad is best at room
temperature.
