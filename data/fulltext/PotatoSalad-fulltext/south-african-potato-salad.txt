Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10
minutes. Remove eggs with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Add whole
potatoes to the water and boil until a knife is easily inserted, but they are
not too soft. Drain and cool.

Peel and chop the eggs and place them in a large serving bowl. Stir in the
green onions. When the potatoes have cooled, peel and chop then add them to
the bowl. Pour in the sweetened condensed milk and stir in the mayonnaise.
Sprinkle parley over the top. Chill until serving. This is best served
chilled.
