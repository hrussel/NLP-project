Steps

Place the potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and
cook for about 10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and
transfer to a large bowl to cool.

In a medium bowl, mix the sour cream, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, eggs,
pickle, celery, green onions, and hot sauce. Season with dill, garlic powder,
onion salt, salt, and pepper. Pour over the potatoes, and gently toss to coat.
Chill at least 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving.
