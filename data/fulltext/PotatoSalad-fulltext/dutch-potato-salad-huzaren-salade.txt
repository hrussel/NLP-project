Steps

Combine 3/4 cup mayonnaise, ketchup, warm water, and vinegar in a large bowl
and mix well. Stir in chopped gherkins, cocktail onions, diced apple, and
shredded carrot. Add corned beef, mashed potatoes, and salt and pepper to
taste; mix well.

Form the potato salad on a plate as a loaf or a round mound. Garnish with
slices of cucumber, halved cherry tomatoes, and slices of egg. Decorate with
swirls or wavy lines of mayonnaise to add a little flair (see Cook's Note).
Chill for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.
