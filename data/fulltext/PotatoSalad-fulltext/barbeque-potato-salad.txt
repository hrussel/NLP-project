Steps

Place cubed potatoes into a large kettle and cover with water. Bring to a boil
over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
the potatoes are just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and spread the potatoes
onto baking sheets in a single layer. Chill the potatoes in the refrigerator
until cold, about 2 hours.

Mix the cooled potatoes, red onion, egg, mayonnaise, barbeque sauce, garlic
powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Sprinkle with paprika if desired.
