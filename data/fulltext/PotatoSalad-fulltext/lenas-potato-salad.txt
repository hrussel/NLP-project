Steps

Place eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Bring water to a
boil, and immediately remove from heat. Cover pan, and let eggs stand in hot
water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool, and peel. Do not
chop.

In a pot with enough water to cover, boil the potatoes 15 minutes, or until
tender. Remove from heat, and allow to remain in the hot water about 10
minutes. Drain, and cool.

Place the eggs and potatoes in a large bowl. By hand, mix in the olives,
mayonnaise, and mustard, and mash the eggs and potatoes. Season with salt and
pepper. Cover, and refrigerate until serving.
