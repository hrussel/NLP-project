Steps

Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; season water with salt
and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are
tender, about 20 minutes; drain. Put potatoes in a slow cooker.

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon slices
to a plate lined with paper towels. Crumble bacon and add to potatoes.

Return skillet to medium heat and reheat bacon drippings. Cook and stir sweet
onions in the drippings until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes; add garlic and
continue cooking until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes more. Pour onion mixture over
the potatoes and bacon.

Stir vinegar, water, sugar, and salt together in a bowl; pour over the potato
mixture. Stir potatoes gently to mix.

Cook on Low, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 hours.
