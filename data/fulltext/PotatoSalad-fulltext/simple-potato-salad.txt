Steps

Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until tender
but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool.

Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to
a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12
minutes. Remove from hot water, and cool.

Peel the eggs and cut around the egg white; keep the yolk whole.

Dice the egg whites and potatoes. Combine in a mixing bowl and add the salad
dressing.

Toss the potatoes and egg; crumble the egg yolk on top and serve chilled.
