Steps

Boil potatoes until soft, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove potatoes to a large
bowl.

While the potatoes are still warm but not steaming, stir in the hard-cooked
eggs with a fork. Mix in the dill pickle, then stir in the mayonnaise. Season
to taste with salt. Continue to stir until potatoes are smashed and not many
big chunks remain.

Ingredients

5 pounds potatoes, peeled, cut into 2 inch chunks

3 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and finely diced

1/2 cup finely chopped dill pickle

2 cups mayonnaise

salt to taste
