Steps

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place potatoes into a pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil
and cook until easily pierced with a fork, about 12 minutes. Drain and pour
into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix with mayonnaise, processed cheese and onion.

While the potatoes are boiling, fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium
heat until crisp. Drain and break into large pieces. Place on top of the
potatoes.

Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until cheese is browned.
