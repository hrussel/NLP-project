Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
tender, about 12 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry while you prepare the
dressing.

Whisk together the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, dill, salt, and pepper.
Stir in the cucumber and green onions. Add the warm potatoes to the dressing
and toss gently to coat with the dressing. Cover and refrigerate for at least
2 hours before serving.
