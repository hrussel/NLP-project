Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 15
minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Allow to cool.

Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover
the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil. Once the
water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water
for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water and cool the eggs under cold running
water in the sink. Peel once cold. Dice the eggs.

In a salad bowl, lightly toss the potatoes, eggs, artichoke hearts, garlic,
Parmesan cheese, croutons, Dijon mustard, rice vinegar, and mayonnaise until
all ingredients are coated with dressing.
