Steps

Place the potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil
over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Allow the potatoes to cool.

While the potatoes are cooking, place the eggs into a saucepan in a single
layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and
bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, remove
from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out
the hot water, then cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel
and dice once cold.

Place the potatoes, beets, eggs, and mayonnaise into a bowl, mix well, and
season to taste with salt and pepper.
