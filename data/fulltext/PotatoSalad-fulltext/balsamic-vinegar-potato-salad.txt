Steps

Place potatoes in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then
cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until tender. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl.

Add the onion, red peppers, olives, and artichokes to the bowl with the
potatoes. In a separate bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, olive oil,
oregano, basil, mustard powder and parsley. Pour over the vegetables, and stir
to coat. Chill for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.
