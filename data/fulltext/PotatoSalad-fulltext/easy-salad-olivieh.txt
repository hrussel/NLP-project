Steps

Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil,
then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender enough to
pierce with a fork, about 30 minutes. Drain and allow cool, then peel and
dice. Place the diced potatoes into a large mixing bowl and refrigerate until
cold. Once cold, fold in the mayonnaise, celery, eggs, chicken, mustard,
olives, salt, and pickles. Refrigerate 2 hours before serving.
