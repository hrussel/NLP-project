Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water. Bring
to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer
until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes, and allow to cool to
room temperature. Dice once cooled.

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat,
turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon
slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Allow to cool, and crumble the bacon into
a large bowl.

Place the cooled potatoes into the bowl with the bacon, and mix in the sour
cream, mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, chives, salt, and pepper. Refrigerate
overnight before serving.
