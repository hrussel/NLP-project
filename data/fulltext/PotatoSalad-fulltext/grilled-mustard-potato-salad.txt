Steps

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook potatoes 10 to 15
minutes, until tender but firm. Drain, and transfer to a medium bowl.

In a small bowl, mix canola oil, vinegar, Dijon mustard, celery salt, and
pepper. Toss 1/2 the mixture with the potatoes.

Arrange potatoes in a single layer on a sheet of foil, and place on the
prepared grill. Turning occasionally, cook 7 to 9 minutes, until lightly
browned. Remove from heat, and cool. Toss with remaining oil mixture to serve.

Ingredients

3 Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
