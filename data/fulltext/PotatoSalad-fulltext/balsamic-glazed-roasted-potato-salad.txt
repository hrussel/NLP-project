Steps

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with
aluminum foil.

Whisk olive oil, 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, honey, paprika, garlic, salt,
and black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir potatoes, mushrooms, and sweet
onion into vinegar mixture; toss to coat. Spread vegetables over prepared
baking sheet.

Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 40
minutes.

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat,
turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon
slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble bacon.

Transfer potato mixture to a large bowl and toss with bacon, green onions,
parsley, and remaining 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar.
