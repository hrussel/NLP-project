Steps

Place red potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender and the peels begin to
crack, about 20 minutes. Drain and let potatoes cool. Peel cooled potatoes and
cut into 1/8-inch dice.

Place potatoes, shrimp, onions, hard-cooked eggs, sweet pickles, and
mayonnaise into a large salad bowl and stir to combine. Season with salt and
black pepper; sprinkle top of salad with paprika. Chill salad at least 3 hours
before serving.
