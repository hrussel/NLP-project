Steps

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until
tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool.

In a large bowl combine potatoes, celery and green onions.

In a small bowl combine vinegar, oil, salt, pepper and dill weed. Pour over
potatoes and toss gently. Refrigerate for several hours, or overnight.

Stir in sour cream, and pickles just before serving. Garnish with tomato
wedges.
