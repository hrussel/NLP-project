Steps

Place the potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a
boil, and cook until tender enough to insert a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain
and cool slightly, then peel and slice.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a layer of potato
slices in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with a layer of onion
slices, and then some of the sliced eggs. Cover with a thin layer of sour
cream. Repeat layering, until ingredients are used up, ending with sour cream
on top. Season with salt and pepper.

Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top layer of
sour cream is golden brown.
