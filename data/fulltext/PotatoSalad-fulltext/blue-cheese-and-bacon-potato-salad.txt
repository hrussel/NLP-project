Steps

Fill a large bowl with iced water. Line a baking sheet with a dish towel.

Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 18 to 20 minutes. Add
green beans to the boiling water; blanch for just 1 minute. Drain potatoes and
green beans; transfer to bowl of iced water to stop cooking process, about 5
minutes. Remove from iced water with a slotted spoon and place on prepared
baking sheet to dry. Cut potatoes into quarters.

Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool bacon
slices on paper towels; crumble.

Whisk vinegar, olive oil, mayonnaise, and mustard together in a large bowl.
Season with salt and black pepper. Add potatoes and green beans; stir to coat.
Top with bacon, blue cheese, and green onions; stir once to incorporate.
