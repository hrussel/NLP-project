Place green bell pepper, carrot, and garlic cloves into a food processor and pulse a few times until the vegetables are very finely chopped.
Transfer chopped vegetables into a large saucepan.
Stir in tomato puree, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, basil, and red pepper flakes; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.
Stir in olive oil and simmer 1 to 2 more minutes.
Sauce may be refrigerated up to 1 week.
