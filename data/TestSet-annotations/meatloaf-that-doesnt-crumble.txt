Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a food processor or blender, combine the bell pepper, onion and celery.
Process until finely chopped, but not liquid.
Transfer to a large bowl.
Add the ground beef, ground pork, cracker crumbs, onion soup mix, salt, pepper, sage and milk.
Mix well using your hands, or if you have a stand mixer, mix using the paddle attachment.
Transfer to a 9x5 inch loaf pan and form into a loaf, mounding in the center.
Cover with a generous layer of ketchup.
Bake for 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven.
Serve hot.
Refrigerate leftovers, slice and serve cold in sandwiches.
