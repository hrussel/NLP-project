Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.
In food processor or blender, pulse stuffing mix to fine crumbs; place in large bowl.
Stir in ground beef, ground pork, onion, green pepper, tomatoes, eggs, seasoned salt, seasoning blend, and pepper.
Use your hands to mix very well; pat into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).
Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.
