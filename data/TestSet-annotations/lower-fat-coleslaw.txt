Whisk mayonnaise, low-fat milk, white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, and salt together in a bowl and allow dressing to stand while preparing vegetables, about 20 minutes.
Pour dressing over cabbage, onion, and carrot in a large salad bowl and toss to combine.
For best flavor, refrigerate slaw at least 2 hours to overnight.
