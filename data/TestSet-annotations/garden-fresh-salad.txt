Place the potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, and cook until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
Add the green beans and wax beans during the last 2 minutes to blanch them.
Drain, and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking.
Cool before adding to the dressing.
In a large bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, celery, dill, salt, and pepper.
Add the cooled potatoes and beans, and stir to coat.
Refrigerate until ready to serve.
