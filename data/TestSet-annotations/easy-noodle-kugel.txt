Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil.
Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
Drain well.
Melt butter in the pot, and stir together the drained noodles, cottage cheese, salt, and applesauce.
Mix in the sugar and cinnamon.
Add the beaten eggs; stir to blend all ingredients.
Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.
Bake until top is very brown, about 1 hour.
