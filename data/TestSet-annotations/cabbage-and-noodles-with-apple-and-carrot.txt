Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; Cook and stir cabbage, carrot, and apple until cabbage is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil.
Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes.
Drain well.
Gently stir noodles into cabbage mixture; season to taste with salt and black pepper.
